1.  Question 1
    In the context of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which tool builds the necessary resources when you input code and choose your cloud platform?

- Kubernetes
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) pipelines
- Containers
- **Terraform**
  - In the context of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Terraform is a tool that builds the necessary resources when you input code and choose your cloud platform.

2. Question 2
   In a DevSecOps model, which statement accurately describes the concept of "policy as code"?

- **It is an approach used to reduce human error by writing policies as code.**
  - The concept of "policy as code" in a DevSecOps model is an approach used to reduce human error by writing policies as code. Writing policies as code allows for improved understanding, reduces the likelihood of human error during implementation, and promotes better collaboration and security throughout the development and operational processes.
- It is a principle stating that only expert developers are allowed to create security policies.
- It is a practice that implies policies cannot be changed after being coded to save time.
- It is a method where only policies written as code are implemented, excluding other types of policies.

3. Question 3
   Cloud security engineers for a large retailer decide to implement a system with policy enforcement automation. They carefully consider sharing and updating policies, preventing security vulnerabilities, and maintaining compliance with government and industry standards. What are the possible outcomes of this strategy? Choose two answers.

- **The policy system will lead to quicker operations and enhanced feedback linked to compliance.**
  - The automated strategy allows for speedy operations since the processes are executed by software and it provides instant feedback about compliance issues, thanks to its immediate reporting system. Also, by coding these standards into the policy system, the automatic check against potential violations improves. The automatic check decreases the likelihood of penalties for non-compliance.
- The policy system will require cloud security engineers to manually enforce and update policies because of the automation.
- The policy system will not provide any feedback or warning signals to cloud security engineers when it encounters policy violations.
- The policy system, when coded with government and industry standards, will maintain better compliance, lowering the chances of violations and subsequent penalties.
- **The policy system, when coded with government and industry standards, will lead to an increase in errors arising from manual cloud computing management.**
  - By coding these standards into the policy system, the automatic check against potential violations improves, decreasing the likelihood of penalties for non-compliance. The automated strategy also allows for speedy operations since the processes are executed by software and it provides instant feedback about compliance issues, thanks to its immediate reporting system.

4. Question 4
   A team lead in a tech startup chooses to manage infrastructure with Terraform. First, they get to know the core Terraform workflow. What is the next step the team lead should implement in the Terraform workflow?

- Begin the feedback loop for reviewing constant changes
- Start the debugging process for the written code
- Apply the written configurations
- **Preview the changes made in the configuration**
  - In the Terraform workflow, after writing the infrastructure as code, the next step is to plan and preview the changes in the configurations.

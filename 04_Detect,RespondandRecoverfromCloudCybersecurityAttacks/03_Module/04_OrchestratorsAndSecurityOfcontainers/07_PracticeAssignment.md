1.  Question 1
    Why is it a best practice to use official image registries to obtain container images?

- Official container registries provide identity and access management services.
- Official container registries provide vulnerability scans.
- Official container registries can scale containers up and down.
- **Official container registries provide trusted and verified images.**

2. Question 2
   What is the security issue with the service account associated with the container?

- **It provides unrestricted access to all of the application developers.**
- It contains a kernel-level vulnerability.
- It is deployed to a staging environment.
- It is not compatible with the container image.

3. Question 3
   Why is a kernel-level container image vulnerability a critical container security issue?

- It introduces configuration drift.
- It isolates applications.
- It introduces new dependency requirements.
- **It can be exploited to gain elevated privileges.**

4. Question 4
   What can be used to address the service account with unrestricted access? Select two answers.

- Patch management
- **The principle of least privilege**
- Infrastructure as code (IaC)
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**

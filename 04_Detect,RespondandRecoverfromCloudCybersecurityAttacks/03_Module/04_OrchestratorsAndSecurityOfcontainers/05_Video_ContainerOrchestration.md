## Container orchestration tools

- Scale containers and load balance
- Allocate resources between containers
- Monitor the health and performance of the application

## Nodes

Machines that can be either physical or virtual, and include one or more containerized applications known as pods

## POds

Containerized applicatins that use shared resources and a specification on how to run containers

## Container clusters

Dynamic systems that manage and place containers, grouped in pods

## Role-based access control (RBAC)

- Type of identity and access management (IAM)
- Involves a template or permission set that determines who can execute what
- Where is can be executed

## Things to avoid

- Granting cluster-admin access to users or teams that don't need high-level access
- Creating roles that are not used

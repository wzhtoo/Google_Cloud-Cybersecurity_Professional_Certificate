1.  Question 1
    A big bank is under a major cybersecurity attack. The bank's security team quickly moves into the incident control phase of their response plan. They decide to use their advanced security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) tool. What unique function do SOAR tools perform during this phase? Select two answers.

- They help draft an incident report.
- They guide teams towards an improvement process, preventing future incidents.
- **They facilitate coordination between team members.**
  - SOAR tools facilitate coordination between team members, help assign tasks, and track progress. They streamline the communication and collaboration process to help the team focus on containment, eradication, and recovery, thereby minimizing the incident's impact.
- **They help assign tasks and track progress.**
  - SOAR tools facilitate coordination between team members, help assign tasks, and track progress. One of the critical aspects of incident control is ensuring that tasks are assigned and progress is monitored. SOAR tools help with this by providing a platform for team members to track their tasks throughout the incident response process.
- They automate workflows and analyze anomalies.

1. Question 2
   A security analyst receives several security alerts. They are responsible for classifying these alerts based on their importance and possible effect on the company's infrastructure. What factors should the security analyst consider when prioritizing these security alerts?

- Detection, analysis, and response time
- Log data, network details, and alert type

  - When prioritizing alerts, the security analyst should consider questions that focus on severity, potential impact, and urgency. These factors ensure that the security analyst addresses the most critical issues first.
- Attack type, vulnerabilities, and remediation

3. Question 3
   Chen is an IT security analyst who receives multiple alerts daily, many of which might be false positives. What strategies should Chen adopt to correctly distinguish between true incidents and false alarms? Select two answers.

- Close all alerts after a fixed time period.
- **Inspect affected systems for signs of breach.**
  - Investigating the evidence and the context of an alert and inspecting affected systems for signs of breach can help a security analyst distinguish a true event from a false positive. Inspecting affected systems for signs of breach helps ensure an alert is not a false positive by identifying any irregular behavior or anomalies within these systems.
- Disregard alerts with low severity.
- **Investigate the evidence and context of each alert.**
  - Investigating the evidence and the context of an alert and inspecting affected systems for signs of breach can help a security analyst distinguish a true event from a false positive. Investigating often involves reviewing patterns of behavior, relationships between different pieces of data, and supporting evidence.
- Focus mainly on log data analysis.

4. Question 4
   Which member of the security operations team conducts a detailed examination to uncover the truth and meaning in an incident?

- **Lead investigator**

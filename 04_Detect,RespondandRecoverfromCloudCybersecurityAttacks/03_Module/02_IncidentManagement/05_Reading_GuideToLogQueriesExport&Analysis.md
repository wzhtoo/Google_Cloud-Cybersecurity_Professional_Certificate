# Guide to log queries, exports, and analysis

When responding to a security incident, reviewing logs is essential in developing a
comprehensive picture of what happened. As a cloud security analyst, you'll frequently use
logs to reconstruct the actions that occurred before and after a security incident. In this
reading, you'll explore Cloud Audit logs, log sinks, and BigQuery.
In the upcoming lab, you'll generate logs to replicate suspicious activity involving the creation
and deletion of cloud resources. You'll then analyze the logs you purposefully generated using
a tool known as BigQuery.
Note: In the lab activity, you'll be using two student user accounts: username 1 and username 2.
You'll use username 1 to generate the log activity and username 2 to analyze the activity in
BigQuery.

1.  Question 1
    What strategy can a tech company use to manage tasks, network security, and regulatory compliance?

- Incorporate Time-to-Live (TTL) Policies
- Apply rate limiting
- Apply authentication between each component
- **Use managed services**

2. Question 2
   The CEO of a startup receives a report discussing the shared responsibility model for cloud security. Which of the following statements from the report accurately reflect the Shared Responsibility Model? Select two answers.

- **The cloud service provider is in charge of monitoring and responding to cloud-related security threats.**
  - The Shared Responsibility Model states that the organization is responsible for protecting their data and assets in the cloud environment and the cloud service provider is in charge of monitoring and responding to cloud-related security threats.
- The organization is responsible for protecting the data and assets stored in the cloud environment.
- **The organization is entirely responsible for securing the physical cloud infrastructure.**
  - The Shared Responsibility Model states that the organization is responsible for protecting their data and assets in the cloud environment and the cloud service provider is in charge of monitoring and responding to cloud-related security threats
- The organization manages physical security and handles threats in the cloud.
- The cloud service provider is responsible for all security aspects of the organization, including data protection.

3. Question 3
   In the DIE triad, how does the ephemeral nature of resources contribute to system security?

- It allows system resources to be easily replaced.
- It makes the system resources immutable.
- It ensures system resources can be dispersed across different zones.
- **It prevents attackers from stealing information that has been deleted.**
  - The ephemeral nature of resources contributes to system security by preventing attackers from stealing information that has been deleted. Ephemeral means that resources, including data, only exist for a short duration. Once resources are removed or deleted, the information does not exist, which reduces the likelihood of attackers stealing already deleted information.

1. Question 4
   What is the main advantage of using immutable infrastructure?

- It allows for an infrastructure that is not dependent on a single zone.
- **It can be easily replaced without modifying the overall system.**
- It ensures the system resources are evenly distributed.
- It helps in the deletion of resources when they're no longer used.

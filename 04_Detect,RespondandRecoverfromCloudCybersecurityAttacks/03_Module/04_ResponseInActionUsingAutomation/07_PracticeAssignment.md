1.  Question 1
    How does the use of playbooks help cloud security teams?

- Playbooks guide cloud service operation.
- Playbooks compile and maintain cloud security rules for stakeholders.
- Playbooks fully automate the incident response process.
- **Playbooks streamline incident investigations.**
  - Playbooks help in cloud security by streamlining incident investigations. They provide predefined steps for incident investigations. When cloud security teams follow these steps, security processes are more efficient, quicker, and less prone to human errors.

2. Question 2
   What are the three steps in a playbook?

- **Trigger, action, and flow**
  - The three steps in a playbook are trigger, action, and flow. "Trigger" initiates the sequence, "action" represents the process that will be carried out, and "flow" refers to the overall orchestration of actions.
- Initialization, operation, and conclusion
- Step process, task, and endpoint
- Input, processing, and output

3. Question 3
   A cloud security analyst is working with a Chronicle SOAR playbook when an alert pops up from a security solution. What role does this alert play in orchestrating the SOAR playbook?

- The alert ensures the efficiency and speed of the playbook's performance.
- The alert serves as a narrative introduction, preparing for the playbookâ€™s initiation.
- **The alert initiates or triggers the playbook's actions.**
  - An alert from a security solution is the trigger that initiates the playbook's actions. The appearance of an alert signals a potential security threat and sets the playbook into motion.
- The alert serves as a final conclusion, resolving the playbook's sequences.

4. Question 4
   In the event of a phishing incident, a cloud security professional should manage the situation using a playbook. What does a playbook do in this situation? Select two answers.

- The playbook distributes warning emails to all members of the organization, regardless of their involvement in the incident.
- The playbook starts a process for replacing compromised servers within the organization's infrastructure.
- **The playbook initiates a series of predetermined actions which are triggered upon receiving an alert from the security system.**
  - In the event of a phishing incident, an alert from a security solution acts as the trigger that initiates the playbook's actions. The playbook blocks the malicious IP addresses associated with the attack, and resets the passwords of accounts that have been compromised. The playbook contains predetermined actions to manage the incident.
- **The playbook blocks the malicious IP addresses associated with the attack and resets the passwords of accounts compromised during the incident.**
  - In the event of a phishing incident, an alert from a security solution acts as the trigger that initiates the playbook's actions. The playbook blocks the malicious IP addresses associated with the attack, and resets the passwords of accounts that have been compromised. Blocking malicious IP addresses and resetting compromised passwords are common actions taken in response to a phishing incident.
- The playbook files a lawsuit against the phishing perpetrators, assuming legal and court procedures can be automated.

1 point 5.
Question 5
A security team engages the incident response process. What starts this process?

- **An actionable alert**
  - An actionable alert starts the incident response process. An actionable alert needs an immediate response.
- A regular alert from the system's security tools
- A failed login event
- The closing step of the response

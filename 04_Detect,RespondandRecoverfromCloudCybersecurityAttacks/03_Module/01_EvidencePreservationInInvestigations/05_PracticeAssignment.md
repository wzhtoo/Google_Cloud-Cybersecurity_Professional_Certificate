1.  Question 1
    A data breach occurs at an online retail company. Kylie, the company's lead cybersecurity analyst, is asked to investigate the breach. Kylie has different types of data available to review. What type of information should Kylie prioritize as digital evidence for the investigation?

- Customer browsing and buying data from the companyâ€™s mobile application in the past month
- Detailed data reports of the company's usage of Google Cloud storage during the breach
- **Unusual IP addresses that were caught interacting abnormally with the company's servers during the breach**
  - Kylie should prioritize unusual IP addresses that were caught interacting abnormally with the company's servers during the breach as digital evidence for the investigation. This type of evidence indicates potential unauthorized access or malicious actors. Analyzing this activity can reveal the source of the breach and help the team implement countermeasures to mitigate the risk.
- Transaction data from customer item returns and exchanges completed in the past month

2. Question 2
   In response to a recent cybersecurity incident, an IT team lead initiates an urgent cybersecurity investigation. Why does the IT team lead encourage teamwork and engage the entire team in the process of preserving digital evidence?

- To collectively decide the pieces of evidence that should be shared with the public
- **To ensure every team member is responsible for the care and integrity of the evidence**
  - The IT team lead engages the entire team in the process of preserving digital evidence to ensure every team member is responsible for the care and integrity of the evidence. Encouraging all team members to collectively hold responsibility helps to maintain the chain of custody and ensure evidence quality.
- To allow everyone to handle, share, and distribute the sensitive data freely among the team
- To speed up the process of evidence collection, bypassing some standard protocols if necessary

3. Question 3
   What does the chain of custody refer to in an incident investigation?

- The order of incidents that have occurred
- **The process of preserving the integrity of the evidence**
  - The chain of custody refers to the process of preserving the integrity of evidence. It involves keeping track of evidence as it progresses through an investigation and ensuring that there is no unauthorized access or tampering.
- The chronological order of tampering and unauthorized access
- The chain of commands followed in an investigation

4. Question 4
   As a cloud data analyst, which unique challenge impacts evidence preservation in the cloud?

- The automatic deletion of data in the cloud
- **The lifespan and scalability of cloud resources**
  - A challenge unique to evidence preservation in the cloud is the unique lifespan and scalability of cloud resources. Cloud resources such as Virtual Machines or containers can be ephemeral or transient. They can be automatically scaled, started, and stopped based on demand, posing a unique challenge to evidence preservation.
- The tampering risks present in the cloud
- The difficulty in finding qualified personnel for cloud evidence analysis

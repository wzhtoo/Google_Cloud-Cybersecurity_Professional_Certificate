1.  Question 1
    A cybersecurity professional faces a major incident that temporarily disables a crucial application, causing some data to be lost. This leads the cybersecurity professional to consider establishing a recovery point objective (RPO) for the application. Based on this scenario, what does the cybersecurity professional need to understand about RPOs?

- RPOs are specific goals that are set by recovery professionals to overcome major cyber threats.
- **RPOs represent the maximum acceptable time during which data can be lost from an application due to an unexpected incident.**
  - RPOs represent the maximum acceptable time during which data can be lost from an application due to an unexpected incident. Defining an RPO helps minimize the impact on crucial applications and aims to maintain business continuity.
- RPOs are the target times established to recover and restore a service in the event of a disaster.
- RPOs are comprehensive reviews of data protection software.

2. Question 2
   Which of the following scenarios has the highest recovery time objective (RTO) tolerance?

- A hospital providing emergency services
- A local bakery's website
- A stock trading platform
- **An online forum for casual discussions**
  - An online forum for casual discussions has a higher recovery time objective (RTO) tolerance. Compared to critical services like hospitals or business activities like the bakery's sales, an online forum would have a higher RTO tolerance.

3. Question 3
   In a disaster recovery plan (DRP), what question can recovery point objectives (RPOs) answer?

- **How much data can be lost before it impacts the company?**
  - A question RPOs can answer is: ‚ÄúHow much data can be lost before it starts to impact the company?‚Äù A RPO is the point in time to which data must be recovered after a disruption occurs
- How can tasks be assigned to minimize hazards?
- How long can business operations that depend on a specific system be down?
- How much time is needed to restore a system?

4. Question 4
   In a disaster recovery plan (DRP), what question can recovery time objectives (RTOs) help answer?

- How much data can be lost before it impacts the company?
- Who is responsible for specific tasks during a disaster?
- What resources are required for hazard mitigation?
- **How long can business operations that depend on a specific system be down?**
  - RTOs address the question: ‚ÄúHow long can business operations dependent on a specific system be down?‚Äù The RTO reflects the maximum amount of time a system can be offline.

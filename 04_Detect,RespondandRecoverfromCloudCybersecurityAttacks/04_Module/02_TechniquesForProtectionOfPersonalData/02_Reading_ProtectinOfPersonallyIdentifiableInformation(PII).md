# Key takeaways

Cryptography is an essential part of protecting data from being read by unauthorized
individuals. Symmetric encryption uses one key to exchange information, while asymmetric
encryption uses a public and private key to encrypt and decrypt data. While the encryption
types differ in how information is exchanged, they both ensure only authorized users can read
the data. As a cloud security professional, youâ€™ll likely use asymmetric and symmetric
encryption to secure data in a variety of situations. With an understanding of what they do,
youâ€™ll be better prepared to use them.

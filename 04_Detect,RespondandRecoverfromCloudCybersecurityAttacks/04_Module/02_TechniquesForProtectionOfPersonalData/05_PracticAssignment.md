1.  Question 1
    What are tags in the context of data classification?

- Tags are security tools attached to mask data from attackers.
- Tags are graphics tools that adjust display settings in data files.
- Tags are software that manipulate data processing speed.
- **Tags are custom metadata fields assigned for context.**
  - Tags are custom metadata fields that cloud security professionals assign to data entries to provide context and help with classifying and managing data.

2. Question 2
   Why are tags crucial for data protection? Select two answers.

- **They enable better organization of sensitive data.**
  - Tags are crucial for data protection because they enable better organization of sensitive data and help security assets find the data that needs to be protected. By organizing sensitive data effectively, tags make it easier to apply security measures and manage data access control.
- They allow users to automate email delivery of sensitive data.
- **They help security assets find the data that needs to be protected.**
  - Tags are crucial for data protection because they enable better organization of sensitive data and help security assets find the data that needs to be protected. Tags provide context and classify data by its sensitivity level, allowing security assets such as firewalls and encryption tools to identify and protect sensitive information accordingly.
- They offer data compression and reduce storage space requirements.
- They analyze website traffic and provide insights into user engagement.

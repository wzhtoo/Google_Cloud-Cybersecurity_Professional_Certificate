# Key takeaways

Keys are created using encryption algorithms. You can use keys to encrypt and decrypt data,
so that itâ€™s secure, and only accessible to those with the key. This keeps your data safe and
confidential. Key management allows you to manage your keys, and most cloud providers offer
key management solutions.When you make keys, you should set rotation periods for them.
Once youâ€™re finished with your keys, you can either disable them temporarily, so you can
enable them again later, or destroy them. If you disable them, you wonâ€™t be able to access your
data.

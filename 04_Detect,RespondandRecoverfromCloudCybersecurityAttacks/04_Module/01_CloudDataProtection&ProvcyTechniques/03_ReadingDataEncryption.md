# Key takeaways

Encryption is important for keeping data safe. It protects data from being changed,
compromised or stolen. Encryption can be used to provide confidentiality, authenticity,
integrity, and nonrepudiation. There are several common encryption standards, including (AES)
and (RSA). AES is a symmetric encryption standard that's used for tasks like online banking and
encrypting personal messages RSA is one of the earliest forms of asymmetric encryption in
computer science, and it's still in use. Data encryption is a vital aspect of data protection. It
keeps transactions and devices secure. It has many benefits that increase security posture.
But, it also has some drawbacks, which are important to be aware of.

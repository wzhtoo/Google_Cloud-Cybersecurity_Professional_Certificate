1.  Question 1
    If an education technology company uses cloud storage, why might it be difficult to manage data localization?

- **Data is stored globally, not locally.**
  - Data in the cloud is stored globally, not locally. This makes it challenging to manage data localization.
- Data centers are only in some regions of the globe.
- Cloud storage moves data abroad.
- Cloud storage systematically violates the principles of data sovereignty.

2. Question 2
   The chief information officer (CIO) of a tech company develops a data retention policy. What should the CIO consider to ensure the policy meets the companyâ€™s needs?

- Data sources originate from different places.
- **Different types of data may need distinct policies.**
  - The CIO should consider that different kinds of data may need different policies. A data retention policy should be flexible and based on an organization's need
- Different datasets need different storage devices.
- Datasets have different sizes.

3. Question 3
   An online store ensures the validity and uniqueness of their customer's data as part of their data governance strategy. What impact does this have on their operations?

- Authorizes data access for internal users
- **Enhances data quality by minimizing duplications**
  - Valid and unique data helps enhance data quality by minimizing duplications. Valid data matches specific criteria, and unique data has fewer duplicates or overlaps.
- Enables more storage in cloud resources
- Accelerates the speed of data analytics

4. Question 4
   Which of the following is a correct analogy regarding the function of data discovery?

- Data discovery is like a guard protecting a bank vault.
- Data discovery is like the lock securing a bank vault.
- **Data discovery is like a bank teller finding customers' money.**
  - Data discovery is like a bank teller finding where customers' money is stored. The same way a bank teller locates a customer's savings, data discovery identifies and locates sensitive or regulated data.
- Data discovery is like a user creating a profile on a banking app.

5. Question 5
   Anna is a data consultant for a growing start-up. What data retention policy should Anna recommend for the companyâ€™s new cloud storage service?

- Recommend a data retention policy that results in the deletion of all account data when a user deactivates their account
- **Recommend a bucket-based policy allowing object deletion or replacement only after objects have exceeded the set retention period**
  - Anna should recommend a bucket-based policy. By implementing a bucket-based policy, the retention period for data is clearly defined, and data can only be deleted or replaced once it has exceeded the set retention period. This approach allows for both consistent enforcement and flexible management of stored data
- Recommend a mandate with compulsory server shutdowns when stored data surpasses the stipulated retention period
- Recommend enforced encryption of data that has aged past the designated retention period

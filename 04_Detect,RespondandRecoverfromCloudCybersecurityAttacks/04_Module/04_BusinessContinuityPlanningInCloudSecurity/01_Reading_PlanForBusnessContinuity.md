# Key takeaways

BC and DR planning are crucial for organizations to maintain productivity during and after
significant disruptions. When a cloud security team builds a well-defined plan, often in
collaboration with a cloud service provider, it clearly outlines responsibilities and measures to
ensure service and data availability. Effective documentation, communication, and teamwork
between the organization and the cloud service provider are vital components of BC and DR
planning.

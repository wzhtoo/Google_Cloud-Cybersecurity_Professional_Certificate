1.  Question 1
    A cybersecurity analyst detects a malicious cryptocurrency miner installed in one of their company's systems. Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) incident response lifecycle, they confirm the incident. What are the next two phases of the NIST lifecycle after confirming the miner's presence? Select two answers.

- Strategize defenses against the miner.
- Set up software to detect more miners.
- **Eliminate the miner and restore the system.**
  - The next two NIST phases are to quarantine the system with the miner, and eliminate the miner and restore the system. They quarantine the affected system to prevent the miner from spreading or causing additional harm. Then, they remove the malicious miner from the affected system while restoring the system to its normal state.
- **Quarantine the system with the miner.**

Then, they remove the malicious miner from the affected system while restoring the system to its normal state.
- Launch a post-activity session about the miner.

2. Question 2
   How does the integration of security tools, like Elastic Stack or AlienVault OSSIM, assist in incident management?

- By helping to assign roles and responsibilities
- By conducting a post-mortem analysis to find gaps
- By communicating the incident status to stakeholders
- **By facilitating efficient real-time threat detection and response**
  - The integration of security tools, like Elastic Stack or AlienVault OSSIM, assist in incident management by facilitating efficient real-time threat detection and response. These tools enhance the organization's Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities, significantly improving its ability to promptly identify and react to potential security threats.

3. Question 3
   What differentiates anomaly-based detection from signature-based detection? Select two answers.

- Anomaly-based detection and signature-based detection can function effectively without regular updates.
- Anomaly-based detection only works with known security threats.
- **Anomaly-based detection does not require signatures.**
  - Anomaly-based detection does not rely on signatures and uses a baseline for network activity. It creates a normal baseline for network activity and monitors for deviations from this baseline, which could signal potential threats.
- Anomaly-based detection relies on the real-time input of security analysts.
- Anomaly-based detection uses a baseline for network activity.
  - Anomaly-based detection does not rely on signatures and uses a baseline for network activity. It creates a normal baseline for network activity and monitors for deviations from this baseline, which could signal potential threats.

4. Question 4
   Raj, a cybersecurity analyst, investigates suspected disguised malicious applications within their Google Cloud. To investigate, Raj uses Google Cloud's Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Which technology component of Google's IDS should Raj use to detect these applications?

- TLS technology
- **App-IDâ„¢ technology**
  - Raj should use App-IDâ„¢ technology to investigate suspected disguised malicious applications within their Google Cloud using Google Cloud's IDS. The IDS aids in identifying applications, regardless of the port, protocol, and encryption, to detect potentially disguised malicious applications.
- NAT technology
- MPLS technology

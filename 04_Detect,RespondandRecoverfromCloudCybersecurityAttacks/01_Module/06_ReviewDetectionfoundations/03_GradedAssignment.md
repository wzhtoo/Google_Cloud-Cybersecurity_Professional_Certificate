1.  Question 1
    How can an organization improve the effectiveness of their alert system to better recognize patterns and reduce false positives?

- Manual review of every alert
- **Use machine learning**
- Ignore low-priority alerts
- Request user feedback for each alert

2. Question 2
   Carol works as an information security analyst. She must focus on multiple activities at one time. Which activity must Carol complete with a high attention to detail, so she can identify potential cybersecurity breaches?

- Finding possible solutions and risk management
- **Spotting patterns and trends in log files**
- Managing multiple tasks and responsibilities
- Staying updated on new tools and practices

3. Question 3
   An IT security analyst faces an intrusion attempt in their digital infrastructure. To identify and analyze the potential threat, they use tools such as Security Command Center, Cloud Logging, and Cloud Monitoring. In which phase of the NIST incident response lifecycle do they use these tools?

- Preparation
- **Detection and Analysis**
- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- Post-Incident Activity

4. Question 4
   Which is a best practice for querying alerts?

- Keep searches broad for maximum results.
- Use searches only once.
- Focus only on low-priority alerts.
- **Save frequently-used searches for future use.**

5. Question 5
   What happens during the Preparation phase of the NIST incident response lifecycle? Select two answers.

- Systems are recovered to their pre-incident state
- A post-incident analysis is conducted to identify areas of improvement
- **An incident response plan is developed**
- Security incidents are identified and analyzed
- **Roles and responsibilities are assigned**

6. Question 6
   A cybersecurity analyst uses very specific queries to detect vulnerabilities in their cloud systems. What issue could they have because of these overly-specific queries?

- Increasing false alarms
- Slowing down threat detection
- Prioritizing irrelevant threat alerts
- **Overlooking possibly important results**

7. Question 7
   A cybersecurity specialist detects suspicious activities in a company account, indicating a possible security breach. They use the NIST incident response lifecycle to respond to the security issue. How should the cybersecurity specialist use identity and access management (IAM) features during the Containment phase of the NIST incident response lifecycle?

- **Disable the compromised accounts**
- Draft a new incident response plan
- Perform a post-mortem analysis
- Apply security patches to their cloud-based software

8. Question 8
   A lead security analyst is dealing with a security breach in their organization's cloud environment. During the Containment and Eradication phase of their incident management plan, what action should they take to prevent the attack from spreading?

- Remove access or deactivate the Service Account
- Carry out a post-incident analysis
- **Establish network segmentation or isolation**
- Organize security awareness programs and training

9. Question 9
   Why should a signature database be regularly updated?

- To add new features
- To prevent false alarms
- **To keep up with emerging threats**
- To maintain the speed of the network

10. Question 10
    What does the Post-Incident Activity phase in an incident management plan involve? Select two answers.

- Assigning roles and responsibilities
- **Determining the root cause of the incident**
- Detecting threats
- **Identifying gaps in the incident response plan**
- Restoring data and applications from backups

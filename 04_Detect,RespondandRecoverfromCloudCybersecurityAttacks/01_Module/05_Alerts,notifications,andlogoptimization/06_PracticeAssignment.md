1.  Question 1
    A security analyst has evidence that an employee is attempting actions against the organization's security guidelines. The security analyst plans to use the company's alert system to monitor this situation. Which kind of alert should they use?

- False positive
- Suspicious login activity
- Unusual network traffic
- **Policy violations**
  - The policy violations alert type is the best choice when an employee is attempting actions against the organization's security guidelines. This type of alert monitors and detects any actions that depart from an organization's security policies or guidelines

2. Question 2
   Rebecca, a cybersecurity specialist, wants to be proactive about potential unauthorized access incidents within the company's cloud environment. What two alert types should Rebecca use to identify unauthorized access in the cloud environment? Choose two answers.

- False positives
- Server downtime
- Policy violations
- **Unusual network traffic**
  - Alerts for unusual network traffic and suspicious login activity often help identify unauthorized access. If there is an unexpected spike in network traffic or data is being accessed from unfamiliar sources, this can indicate unauthorized access. Alerts for unusual network traffic and suspicious login activity help monitor and notify teams about such instances, which helps to prevent potential security threats.
- Suspicious login activity
  - Alerts for unusual network traffic and suspicious login activity often help identify unauthorized access. Alerts set for suspicious login activity are designed to track login attempts from unfamiliar locations, or repeated login attempts, which could also signify unauthorized access.

3. Question 3
   A cybersecurity analyst starts using the Chronicle SIEM tool. What impact will this tool have on the alert search techniques they use in their cloud security work?

- The tool simplifies tasks by reducing the importance of severity when adjusting the parameters of alert filters.

- The tool reduces the necessity of filter reassessment or changes in the analystâ€™s cybersecurity practice.

- **The tool generates machine learning-driven insights to simplify data management in handling cloud security events.**

  - Chronicle SIEM provides machine learning-based insights to simplify data management in handling cloud security events. This also includes enhancing alert search techniques.

- The tool allows the analyst to use wide, underdefined queries in their cybersecurity investigations.

4. Question 4
   What are some common filter types used in querying alerts?

- **Alert source, destination, severity, and time**

  - A filter could be based on an alert's source, destination, severity, and time, effectively narrowing the search results and streamlining security operations.
  - Filters focus on specific details like event categories, severity levels, or time frames.

- Alert color coordination, network size, hardware type, and floor location
- Alert priority, resolution time, and format
- Alert color, size, format, and font

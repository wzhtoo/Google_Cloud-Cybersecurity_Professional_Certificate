1.  Question 1
    A junior engineer tries to modify a database in Google Cloud (GC), but the engineerâ€™s current Identity and Access Management (IAM) role does not grant the required permissions. To follow up, the IT manager investigates the junior engineerâ€™s access attempt. Which type of log in Google Cloud should the IT manager check?

- Admin activity audit logs
- System event audit logs
- Data access audit logs
- **Policy denied audit logs**
  - Policy denied audit logs capture instances where requests were denied because of existing IAM policies. The IT manager can find unauthorized modification requests by users without the required permissions in these logs

2. Question 2
   A chief information security officer and IT manager consider moving some logs to cold storage or even storing them offline. Why might they choose to take this step?

- To facilitate regular, comprehensive system backups using stored log information
- To create a more effective collaboration environment through the sharing of log data with trusted partners
- **To protect vital log data during undetected, prolonged security breaches**
  - They might choose to take this step because storing logs in cold storage or offline can help protect vital log data during undetected, prolonged security breaches. This approach can help keep essential logs available.
- To dramatically boost server performance through the offloading of stored logs

1.  Question 1
    What is vulnerability remediation in the context of cloud security?

- The process of creating, training, and managing AI models in a cloud environment
- T**he process of identifying, assessing, and resolving security vulnerabilities in a cloud environment**
  - Vulnerability remediation is the process of identifying, assessing, and resolving security vulnerabilities in a cloud environment.
- The process of scheduling and managing tasks in a cloud environment
- The process of pricing, planning, and budgeting resources in a cloud environment

2. Question 2
   A cloud security manager detects several security vulnerabilities in their organization's cloud environment. As a part of vulnerability remediation, the cloud security manager prioritizes the vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and ease of exploitation. Then, they implement the necessary patches and updates to address the identified vulnerabilities. What is the cloud security managerâ€™s next step to ensure that the vulnerabilities were effectively resolved?

- Reassess the entire cloud environment to identify potential undiscovered vulnerabilities.
- Allocate additional resources to the cloud environment.
- Share a press release immediately about the vulnerability discoveries.
- **Verify the remediation efforts and confirm the resolutions.**
  - To ensure that the vulnerabilities were effectively resolved, the cloud security managerâ€™s next step should be to verify the remediation efforts and confirm the resolutions

3. Question 3
   A security manager needs to write a vulnerability remediation plan for a software development process. Which components should they include in the plan? Select two answers.

- **Identify the vulnerability**
  - Identifying the vulnerability and developing a remediation plan are two components of vulnerability remediation in the software development process.
- Add new features to the application
- Optimize server infrastructure
- Develop a remediation plan
- Reduce application loading time

4. Question 4
   What IT automation tool is open-source, has agentless architecture, and uses YAML for defining automation tasks?

- Puppet
- Google Cloud Platform
- **Ansible**
  - Ansible is an IT automation tool that is open-source, has agentless architecture, and uses YAML for defining automation tasks.
- Vulnerability scanners

5. Question 5
   An IT administrator needs to safely deploy a security update. They start with a small group of systems to monitor the impact before deploying the update to the entire environment. In this scenario, what best practice for validating security remediations is the IT administrator using?

- Blue/green testing
- Rolling deployments
- Infrastructure as code
- **Canary testing**
  - The IT administrator is using canary testing to deploy a security update in the safest possible manner. They do this by starting with a small group of systems to monitor the impact before deploying the update to the entire environment.

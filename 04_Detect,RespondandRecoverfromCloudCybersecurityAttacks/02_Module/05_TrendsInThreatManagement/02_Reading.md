# Key takeaways

AI and ML are constantly evolving, and as they do, thereâ€™ll be more ways to use them to help
with your security duties. For example, AI and ML might help you find vulnerabilities and
analyze data.
IoT is another emerging technological trend. IoT can help you collect data about the security
posture of cloud environments on devices connected to your systems and linked to the
internet and the cloud. IoT can also help you communicate with other connected devices and
individuals.
In your role as a cloud security professional, youâ€™ll find many ways to use AI, ML, and IoT to help
you stay ahead of the threat actors that can compromise your system.

1.  Question 1
    In what step of Lockheed Martinâ€™s Cyber Kill ChainÂ® is the information about the target gathered?

- Weaponization
- **Reconnaissance**
  - In the reconnaissance step, the attacker focuses on gathering information about the target.
- Command and control
- Actions on objectives

2. Question 2
   What is the goal of the exploitation step in Lockheed Martinâ€™s Cyber Kill ChainÂ®?

- **To gain access to the target**
  - During the exploitation step, the goal is for the attacker to gain access to the target.
- To identify and prioritize threats to improve defenses
- To gather information about a potential target
- To install backdoors into the system

3. Question 3
   Zara, a cloud security professional, is receiving numerous false positive alerts. Zara discusses the challenge with her colleague, Raj, an experienced cybersecurity expert. Which does Raj think is the cause of the false positive alerts? Select two answers.

- **Misconfigurations in tools and systems**
  - Misconfigurations in tools and systems and over engineered detection strategies can cause false positive alerts. Misconfigurations can cause security systems to incorrectly identify harmless events as threats, leading to false positives
- Frequent cloud service provider audits
- Comprehensive security awareness training for employees
- **Over engineered detection strategies**
  - Misconfigurations in tools and systems and over engineered detection strategies can cause false positive alerts. Over engineered systems sometimes create overly sensitive alerts, causing false positives to be generated.
- Strict adherence to cloud security best practices

  4. Question 4
     What is the final step of Lockheed Martinâ€™s Cyber Kill ChainÂ®?

- Installation
- Command and control
- Exploitation
- **Actions on objectives**
  - Actions on objectives is the final step in Lockheed Martinâ€™s Cyber Kill ChainÂ®. In this step, the attacker takes action to achieve their goals, such as data exfiltration, data destruction, or encryption for ransom.

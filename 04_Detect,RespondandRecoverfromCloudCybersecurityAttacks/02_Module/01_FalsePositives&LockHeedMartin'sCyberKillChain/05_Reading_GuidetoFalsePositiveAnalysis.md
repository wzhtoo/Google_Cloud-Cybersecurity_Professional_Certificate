# Guide to false positive analysis

False positives are something that youâ€™ll likely encounter at some point in your journey as a
cloud security analyst. As a reminder, a false positive is an alert that incorrectly detects the
presence of a threat. It's important to understand the context behind an alert when you're
addressing false positive alerts. In the upcoming lab activity, you'll recreate and analyze an
Identity and Access Management (IAM) false positive pertaining to a test service account that
a Cymbal Bank team member created. In this reading, you'll explore how insecure IAM
permissions and key management practices can trigger false positives alerts in Security
Command Center (SCC).
Note: Security Command Center has two service tiers: Standard and Premium. The tier type
determines which built-in services and their features are available to use. In this program, the
labs provide you with access to the Premium tier.

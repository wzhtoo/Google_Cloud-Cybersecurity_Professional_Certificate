1.  Question 1
    A security analyst decides to implement the five best practices to manage indicators of compromise (IoC). First, the analyst proactively monitors systems. Next, they conduct investigations whenever needed, and lead a timely response to any threats they detect. What are the two additional best practices the analyst should implement? Select two answers.

- File renaming
- Email filtering
- **Documentation**
  - The five general best practices on how to manage IoC are proactive monitoring, thorough investigations, risk assessment, timely response, and documentation. Clear documentation helps security teams share and access knowledge, improve future investigations, and enhance incident response processes.
- **Risk assessment**
  - The five general best practices on how to manage IoC are proactive monitoring, thorough investigations, risk assessment, timely response, and documentation. Risk assessment helps security teams understand potential impacts.
- Inventory management

2. Question 2
   A security team responsible for protecting an organization's cyber infrastructure plans to implement threat hunting tools. Which aspect of threat hunting tools will help the team deal with critical threats quickly?

- Automated detection
- Pattern recognition
- **Alert prioritization**
  - Alert prioritization will help the security team deal with critical threats quickly. Threat hunting tools use alert prioritization to prioritize alerts based on severity. This prioritization helps security teams focus their efforts on the most pressing issues
- Historical analysis

3. Question 3
   A cybersecurity expert is tasked with preparing a large volume of data for analysis. What will they do to ensure data normalization?

- Explore the relationships between two or more events.
- Compare security events, add context, and establish connections among the events.
- **Process raw data to achieve consistent formatting.**
  - Normalization focuses on processing raw data to achieve consistent formatting. This improves correlation performance by ensuring data is consistently formatted and easier to analyze.
- Gather vast amounts of data from various sources.

4. Question 4
   Emeka uses regular expression (RegEx) to sort through vast amounts of log data. When Emeka identifies a piece of text that matches a specific pattern, what will the RegEx tool do?

- Change the visual formatting or "dress" the matched text.
- Reorganize all data and place the matched text at the bottom, or "recycle" it.
- Remove the matched text from the data set.
- **Find and retrieve the matched text for further analysis.**
  - RegEx finds and retrieves the matched text for further analysis when a piece of text matches a specific pattern. This allows analysts like Emeka to focus on potential areas of concern in massive datasets to enhance their efficiency.

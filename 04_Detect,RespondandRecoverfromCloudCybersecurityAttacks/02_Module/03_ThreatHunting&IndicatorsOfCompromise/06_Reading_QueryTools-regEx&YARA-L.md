# Query tools: RegEx and YARA-L

As youâ€™ve learned, regular expression (RegEX) is a sequence of characters that form a pattern.
You can use RegEx to search through log data and extract the relevant information you need.
Youâ€™ve also learned about YARA-L. YARA-L is a computer language that is used to create
detection rules for searching through ingested log data. In this reading, youâ€™ll take a deeper
dive into RegEx, and youâ€™ll learn about best practices to use with YARA-L.

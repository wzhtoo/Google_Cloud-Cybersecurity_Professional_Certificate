1.  Question 1
    In the context of threat hunting, what are techniques?

- Techniques refer to the length or timing of attacks.
- **Techniques detail the specific actions taken by attackers.**
- Techniques provide methods to avoid an attack.
- Techniques are policies created by companies to reduce attacks.

2. Question 2
   Sam is a cloud security professional. Recently, Sam identified a significant increase in false positive alerts. What is a consequence of these false positive alerts for Sam and the cloud security team?

- Improved precision in threat detection
- **Greater vulnerability to actual threats**
- More resources dedicated to managing threat alerts
- Increased cooperation within the security team

3. Question 3
   A chief security officer at a manufacturing company recently implemented Chronicle SIEM and studied the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework. Why would the security officer use MITRE ATT&CKÂ® with tools like Chronicle SIEM? Select two answers.

- To focus on one alert at a time
- **To map security controls**
- To solely rely on automated detection
- To ignore low severity alerts
- **To uncover defensive gaps**

4. Question 4
   A security officer considers integrating the MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework into their security team's threat hunting efforts. What primary value would this framework introduce to the team's threat hunting activities?

- **It offers a standardized language to understand threat patterns and tactics.**
- It functions as a specialized tool for repairing system vulnerabilities that have been identified.
- It provides a strategy for overlooking minor or insignificant threat signals.
- It incorporates a methodology designed to significantly reduce response time to threat alerts.

5. Question 5
   Janice, the new head of cybersecurity, is working with her team on threat hunting. During a case review of a recent cyber attack, the team identifies the exact method an attacker might use to exploit a vulnerability. What is the term for this method?

- Strategy
- Technique
- **Procedure**
- Tactic

6. Question 6
   A cloud security analyst learns about a tool called Event Threat Detection. What is the primary function of this tool?

- Add firewalls to servers and ensure their protection
- **Identify potential attacks and put out an alert**
- Detect and fix misconfigurations in system settings
- Automate the process of asset categorization and update the timeline

7. Question 7
   What is the goal of the installation step in the Cyber Kill ChainÂ®?

- To prepare an attack
- To destroy the target's system
- **To maintain access without the target knowing**
- To gather information for the attack

8. Question 8
   What does the delivery step in the Cyber Kill ChainÂ® typically involve?

- Delivering physical goods
- Delivering a security report
- Installing new infrastructure
- **Executing social engineering techniques**

9. Question 9
   Emma is programming a new feature and needs to use regular expressions (RegEx) to analyze text. In her use of RegEx, Emma uses the following symbol: .

- What functionality does this period symbol have?
- It helps Emma identify any whitespace character in her text.
- **It matches any single character in Emmaâ€™s text.**
- It recognizes any digit in Emmaâ€™s text.
- It matches a specific range of characters in Emmaâ€™s text.

10. Question 10
    What are tactics in threat hunting?

- The methods used to repair vulnerabilities
- **The reasons for an attacker performing an action**
- The software used to conduct an attack
- The specific actions of an attacker

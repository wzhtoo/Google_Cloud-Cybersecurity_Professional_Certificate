# Scenario

For the last year, you've been working as a junior cloud security analyst at Cymbal Retail. Cymbal Retail is a market powerhouse currently operating 170 physical stores and an online platform across 28 countries. They reported $15 billion in revenue in 2022, and currently employ 80,400 employees across the world.

Cymbal Retail boasts a vast customer base with a multitude of transactions happening daily on their online platform. The organization is committed to the safety and security of its customers, employees, and its assets, ensuring that its operations meet internal and external regulatory compliance expectations in all the countries it operates in.

Recently, the company has experienced a massive data breach. As a junior member of the security team, youâ€™ll help support the security team through the lifecycle of this security incident. You'll begin by identifying the vulnerabilities related to the breach, isolate and contain the breach to prevent further unauthorized access, recover the compromised systems, remediate any outstanding compliance related issues, and verify compliance with frameworks.

Hereâ€™s how you'll do this task: First youâ€™ll examine the vulnerabilities and findings in Google Cloud Security Command Center. Next, youâ€™ll shut the old VM down, and create a new VM from a snapshot. Then, youâ€™ll evoke public access to the storage bucket and switch to uniform bucket-level access control. Next, youâ€™ll limit the firewall ports access and fix the firewall rules. Finally, youâ€™ll run a report to verify the remediation of the vulnerabilities.

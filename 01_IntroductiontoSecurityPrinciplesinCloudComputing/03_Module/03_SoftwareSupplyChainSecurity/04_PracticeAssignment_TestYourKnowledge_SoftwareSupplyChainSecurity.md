1.  Question 1
    What is the term for the people, processes, and tools that play a role in software development?

- The CI/CD pipeline
- **The software supply chain**
  - The software supply chain includes the people, processes, and tools that play a part in software development.
- The waterfall method
- The software bill of materials

2.  Question 2
    What is the purpose of the Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) framework?

- To combine multiple security levels into one track
- To prioritize placing trust in users with access to build platforms
- **To provide standards for hardening an organization’s security posture**
  - SLSA’s standards and recommended technical controls help cybersecurity teams reinforce security throughout the supply chain, hardening an organization’s security posture.
- To offer recommendations for minimizing artifacts in a software bill of materials

3. Question 3
   An organization adopts the SLSA framework to improve their security posture. What new security practices might the organization start using? Select two answers.

- Change how they measure the integrity of developers’ coding practices.
- Assume their platforms implement correct security measures.
- **Use a build platform that provides protection against tampering.**
  - SLSA requires that any dependencies used in an artifact are examined using security checks and that the build platform used provides protection against tampering. Organizations can use SLSA’s standards and recommended technical controls to reinforce security throughout the supply chain.
- **Examine any dependencies used in an artifact using security checks.**
  - SLSA requires that any dependencies used in an artifact are examined using security checks and that the build platform used provides protection against tampering.

Organizations can use SLSA’s standards and recommended technical controls to reinforce security throughout the supply chain.

- Remove focus from the processes and tools used to build an artifact.

4. Question 4
   What is the term for a digital object, like a file or image, used in the software development lifecycle?

- **An artifact**
  - An artifact is a digital object, like a file or image, used in the software development lifecycle.
- An SBOM
- A trust boundary
- A software supply chain

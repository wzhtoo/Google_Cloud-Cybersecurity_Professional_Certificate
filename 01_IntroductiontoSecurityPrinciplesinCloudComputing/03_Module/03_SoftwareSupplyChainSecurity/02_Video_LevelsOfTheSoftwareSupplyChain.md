[Video_Levels Of The Software Supply Chain &#128279;](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-security-principles-in-cloud-computing/lecture/lTCPs/levels-of-the-software-supply-chain)

- **SLSA (ဆော့) :** Supply chain levels for software artifacts
- **Artifact :** A digital object, like a file or image, that is used in the software development lifecyclye

## SLSA guiding principles

- Prioritizes placing trust in build platforms and code
- Does not assume a platform implements correct security measures
- Requires documentation that proves builds are securely configured

## SLSA Framework

- Build integrity
- Source integrity
- Depnedencies

## Provenance

- A description of the processes and tools used to build an artifact

- **Technical Controls :**
  - Versin control
  - Vulnerability scanning
  - Build verification
  - Deployment policies
  - Artifact management

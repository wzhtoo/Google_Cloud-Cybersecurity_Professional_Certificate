1.  Question 1

What process uses automation and tools to facilitate movement through each phase of the software development lifecycle?

- **Software pipeline**
  - A software pipeline is a process that uses automation and tools to facilitate movement through each phase of the software development lifecycle. Software pipelines address many issues of the waterfall method
- Project requirements
- The waterfall method
- DevSecOps

2. Question 2
   A software company chooses to move from the waterfall method to a software pipeline. What are two likely results of this change? Select two answers.

- Each step of the software development lifecycle will need to be completed before moving on to the next step.
- **Seamless security scans will be enabled.**
  - Using a software pipeline is a common solution to the issues of the waterfall method; it allows for seamless security scans and lets developers modify an application’s code without disturbing other parts of the project.
- **Developers will be able to modify an application’s code without disturbing other parts of the project.**
  - Using a software pipeline is a common solution to the issues of the waterfall method; it allows for seamless security scans and lets developers modify an application’s code without disturbing other parts of the project.
- The team will not be able to revise steps of the software development lifecycle once they are completed.
- Software testing will only occur during the second half of the cycle.

3. Question 3
   What security measure do organizations use as part of the CI/CD pipeline?

- Managers submit approval before the team moves to the next phase of software development.
- Developers use manual security checks to prevent service accounts from accessing deploy builds.
- Users receive app updates infrequently, giving analysts a longer period to detect bugs.
- **Developers incorporate automated security tests through each phase of development.**
  - The CI/CD pipeline incorporates automated security checks throughout each phase of development to keep the entire pipeline secure.

4. Question 4
   Developers at a software company are creating and updating code. Next, the developers will upload the code into a shared repository. What phase of the CI/CD pipeline is taking place?

- Continuous delivery
- Continuous deployment
- Continuous automation
- **Continuous integration**
  - In the continuous integration phase of the CI/CD pipeline, developers continuously create and update code that’s uploaded into a shared repository. For example, uploading the code automatically triggers a validation process, builds an image, and stores code in a repository.

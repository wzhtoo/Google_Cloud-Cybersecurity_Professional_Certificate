1.  Question 1
    A software company begins using infrastructure as code (IaC) to configure their cloud infrastructure. Which two benefits will the company experience? Select two answers.

- Decreased need for security checks
- **Decreased risk of human error**
  - Using IaC means IT no longer needs to manually configure infrastructure, which eliminates the risk of human error and eliminates configuration drift.
- **Decreased configuration drift**
  - Using IaC means IT no longer needs to manually configure infrastructure, which eliminates the risk of human error and eliminates configuration drift.
- Increased versions of source code
- Increased need to patch issues

2. Question 2
   What practice includes provisioning and managing computing and storage resources using reusable scripts?

- Policy as code
- GitOps
- **Infrastructure as code (IaC)**
  - Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the practice of provisioning and managing infrastructure using reusable scripts. IaC’s automation capabilities are important in cloud computing because of its increased amount of infrastructure components and the need to easily scale resources.
- Commit

3. Question 3
   How can using GitOps improve an organization’s security posture?

- It eliminates the use of pull requests.
- It eliminates the need for CI/CD methodology.
- It supports separate teams that need to use different version control systems.
- **It supports shifting left.**
  - GitOps supports the DevSecOps security mindset of shifting left because it allows cloud security analysts to incorporate security best practices throughout the CI/CD pipeline.

4. Question 4
   A software company is considering implementing policy as code (PaC). How can PaC improve the organization’s compliance?

- **Policies can be codified to automatically identify compliance violations.**
  - PaC can be codified to automatically identify compliance violations. Automating these triggers removes the need to manually decide what policy to test and when to test that policy’s integrity.
- Manual testing can be used to assess security policies’ integrity.
- Repositories can be used to create multiple sources of truth for configuration files.
- Version control can be used to block all incoming threats.

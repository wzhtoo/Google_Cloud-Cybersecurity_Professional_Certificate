## Infrastructure as code (IaC)

- The practice of automating and managing infrastructure using reusable scripts
- Using the declarative approach, you define the system's desired state fro mthe start.

- **IaC benefits**
  - Loewrs costs
  - Helps to eliminate risk of human error
  - Encourages faster and more efficient development
  - Accelerates the speed of delivery
  - Reduce configuration drift.
- **Configuration Drift :**
  - When a resources's configuration has altered from its original or expected state
- **IaC benefits**
  - Increases accountability

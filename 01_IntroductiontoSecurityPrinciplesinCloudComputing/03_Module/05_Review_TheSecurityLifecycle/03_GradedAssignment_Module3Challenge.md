1.  Question 1
    How does IaC help to prevent configuration drift?

- **Using one configuration file as the single source of truth**
- Increasing the amount of physical hardware
- Detecting threats in virtual machines
- Listing software components and dependencies

2. Question 2
   A software company wants to make their development process more secure and efficient. What step should the company take?

- **Use a software pipeline with automated security scans**
- Delete their IaC repository
- Discontinue continuous deployment
- Create service accounts for individual human users

3. Question 3
   A software product is in the test stage of the CI/CD pipeline when a bug is found in the build’s code. What step will the pipeline take next?

- **Stopping the process until developers fix the problem**
- Analyzing user feedback to determine how impactful the bug is
- Automatically editing the source code
- Pushing the code to a production environment

4. Question 4
   A DevSecOps team is using the CI/CD pipeline. A build is scanned for vulnerabilities and added to the image repository. What security measure can the team take as part of this step?

- **Applying IAM permissions to access the images**
- Requiring manual approval to push software to users
- Implementing configuration drift to each image
- Eliminating automation from all processes

5. Question 5
   An organization is using the CI/CD pipeline for software development. What will occur during the CD phase? Select two answers.

- **Builds will be released to a staging environment.**
- **Builds will be deployed into a production environment.**
- Code will be tested in one large batch.
- Code will be uploaded to a repository.
- Code will be automatically generated.

6. Question 6
   An organization adapts the GitOps framework. What two processes might this change include? Select two answers.

- **Using IaC as a core process for automation**
- **Using continuous integration as a method for submitting pull requests**
- Using separate tools for infrastructure and application development
- Testing policies manually
- Testing code directly before release

7. Question 7

A cloud security analyst needs to update their organization's IaC. What is the first step the analyst will take to achieve this IaC update?

- **Initiating a pull request**
- Shifting left
- Triggering an alert
- Taking the organization’s resources offline

8. Question 8
   A software company is using the CI/CD pipeline. What practice will carry throughout each phase of the pipeline?

- **Monitoring**
- Deployment
- Security training
- Build triggering

9. Question 9
   Why was the DevSecOps framework developed?

- **To reduce issues in software releases**
- To reduce software testing during development
- To slow excessive communication between teams
- To eliminate the code analysis process

10. Question 10
    As a cloud security analyst, you are assigned to choose the tools your organization will use in its software pipeline. What two goals can these tools achieve? Select two answers.

- **Enabling modular testing**
- **Compiling and analyzing code**
- Alerting teams to revisit steps
- Writing new code
- Determining project requirements

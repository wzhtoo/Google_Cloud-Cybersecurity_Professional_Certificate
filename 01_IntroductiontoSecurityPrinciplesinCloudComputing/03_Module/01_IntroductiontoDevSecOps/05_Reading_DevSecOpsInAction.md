1.  Question 1
    What is the term for a culture that consists of guidelines, best practices, and tools that cloud security teams can use to collaborate?

- Software development lifecycle
- **DevSecOps**
  - DevSecOps is a culture that consists of guidelines, best practices, and tools that development, operations, and security teams can use to collaborate. DevSecOps has become an integral part of the software development lifecycle.
- GitHub
- Shift left

2. Question 2
   In the mid-2000s, the DevOps framework was developed. What two benefits did this framework provide? Select two answers.

- Priorities became more disparate between development and operations teams.
- **Collaboration between developers and operations improved.**

  - The two benefits of the DevOps framework include collaboration between developers and operations and continuous monitoring and testing of applications throughout the development lifecycle. Improved collaboration means the ops team is more involved throughout the development process, enabling them to advocate for the end user’s needs earlier in the cycle.

- **Software applications were monitored and tested continuously.**

  - DevOps culture incorporates collaboration between developers and operations, and continuous monitoring and testing of applications throughout the development lifecycle. Using a DevOps framework, software is continuously monitored, tested, and released.

- Security checks and practices were implemented at every stage of the software development lifecycle.
- A “shift left” occurred in the software development lifecycle.

3. Question 3
   A software company transitions from a DevOps framework to a DevSecOps framework. What process might this change include?

- Conducting security checks only at the last stage of the software development lifecycle
- **Conducting automatic security testing throughout the software development lifecycle**
  - DevSecOps incorporates automating security testing from the start of the application development process. This reinforces the security concept of shifting left
- Monitoring, testing, and releasing each software product only once to save time and money
  Maintaining the development, security, and operations teams as separate entities

4. Question 4
   Why is an infinity loop a useful illustration for the DevSecOps lifecycle?

- **Software is continuously monitored, tested, and released.**
  - An infinity loop is a useful illustration for the DevSecOps lifecycle because the process has no end: Software is continuously monitored, tested, and released. Security is addressed throughout the lifecycle.
- Developer roles and operations team roles are separated.
- Security checks are moved to the final step in the process on an ongoing basis.
- Communication between teams is limited.

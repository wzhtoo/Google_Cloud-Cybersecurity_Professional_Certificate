1.  Question 1
    In which model of cloud computing does the cloud service provider (CSP) have the least responsibility?

- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Software as a service (SaaS)
- Shared fate
- **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**
  - The CSP has the least responsibility in the IaaS model. In IaaS, the CSP provides instant access to infrastructure services, ranging from compute, storage, and networking, to virtualization. The customer manages all other services, like virtual machines, operating systems, data, and security.

2. Question 2
   A company moving its infrastructure to the cloud selects the platform as a service (PaaS) cloud service model. In this scenario, what is the CSP responsible for?

- Writing code and managing applications
- Increasing workloads for customer IT and development teams
- **Supplying and managing hardware and software resources**
  - In the PaaS model, the customer is responsible for writing the code and managing the apps, data, and security, while the CSP supplies and manages the hardware and software resources needed to develop applications. In this model, IT and development teams have fewer operational responsibilities.
- Ensuring the security of the customerâ€™s data

3. Question 3
   A small software company is planning to move their infrastructure to the cloud. What two capabilities can the software company gain from choosing an IaaS model? Select two answers.

- Devote more time to managing their cloud services and security.
- **Configure their cloud resources to increase and decrease depending on their needs.**
  - IaaS is scalable, so customers can configure their resources to increase and decrease on-demand depending on their needs; the CSP manages the physical infrastructure, so IT teams can devote more time to managing services and security.
- Rely on the CSP to deploy applications to their cloud infrastructure.
- **Rely on the CSP to manage security for their cloud infrastructure.**
  - IaaS is scalable, so customers can configure their resources to increase and decrease on-demand depending on their needs; the CSP manages the physical infrastructure, so IT teams can devote more time to managing services and security.
- Maintain the underlying equipment and devices needed to run their cloud infrastructure.

4. Question 4
   What is the term for a cloud-hosted application accessed over the internet through a web browser or mobile app?

- **Software as a service (SaaS)**
  - SaaS is a cloud-hosted application software accessed over the internet through a web browser or mobile app. Customer responsibilities with this model include securing their data and access policies.
- Overhead
- Identity as a service (IDaaS)
- Lift and shift

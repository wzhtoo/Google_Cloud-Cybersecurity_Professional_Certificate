1.  Question 1
    What is the term for a layered approach to vulnerability management that reduces risk?

- **Defense in depth**
  - Defense in depth is a layered approach to vulnerability management that reduces risk. Adding multiple layers of security controls increases the overall security of cloud resources.
- Protective controls
- Firewall
- Intrusion detection system (IDS)

2. Question 2
   What are two types of security controls used to defend cloud resources? Select two answers.

- A network control
- A detective control
- A recovery control

4. Question 4
   Which tool is an example of a detective control?

- **An intrusion detection system (IDS)**
  - Detective controls, such as intrusion detection systems, are used to identify suspicious activity if it occurs. An intrusion detection system monitors system activity and alerts analysts if there is a possible intruder.

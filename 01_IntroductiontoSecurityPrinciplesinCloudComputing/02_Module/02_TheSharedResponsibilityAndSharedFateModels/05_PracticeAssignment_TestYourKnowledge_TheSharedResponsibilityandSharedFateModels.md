1.  Question 1
    What is the term for the implicit and explicit agreement between the customer and the cloud service provider (CSP) regarding the accountability for security control?

- Service-level agreement
- On-premises model
- In-cloud security
- **Shared responsibility model**
  - The shared responsibility model is the implicit and explicit agreement between the customer and the CSP regarding the shared accountability for security control.

2. Which two elements of cloud security are CSPs generally always responsible for? Select two answers.

- Responding to incidents
- Securing the customer’s data
- **Ensuring network and resource availability**
  - The CSP is responsible for protecting the security of the cloud by maintaining physical infrastructure and ensuring network and resource availability. Depending on the service type, the customer is responsible for configuring the services they use and securing the data they store in the cloud.
- Configuring the service to meet the customer’s requirements

- **Maintaining physical infrastructure**
  - The CSP is responsible for protecting the security of the cloud by maintaining physical infrastructure and ensuring network and resource availability. Depending on the service type, the customer is responsible for configuring the services they use and securing the data they store in the cloud.

3. Question 3
   What three things can cloud users do to prevent misconfigurations from causing security vulnerabilities? Select three answers.

- Provide service-level agreements, or SLAs.
- Allow the CSP to coordinate data security.
- **Incorporate automation and safe security policies.**
  - Cloud users can prevent misconfigurations by closely monitoring resource provisioning, incorporating automation and safe security policies, and properly managing IAM policies using the principle of least privilege. Misconfiguration is the leading cause of security breaches in the cloud.
- Closely monitor resource provisioning.
- Maintain physical infrastructure.
- **Properly manage IAM policies.**
  - Cloud users can prevent misconfigurations by closely monitoring resource provisioning, incorporating automation and safe security policies, and properly managing IAM policies using the principle of least privilege. Misconfiguration is the leading cause of security breaches in the cloud.

4. Question 4
   What cloud services model was created to increase the level of trust between the users of cloud services and the cloud service provider?

- **Shared fate**
  - The primary purpose of the shared fate model is to increase the level of trust between the users of cloud services and the cloud service provider. In shared fate, the cloud service provider invests more time to develop resources to help the customer design, deploy, and operate their cloud environment.
- Shared responsibility
- Least privilege
- Transparent relationship

5. Question 5
   What are two characteristics of the shared fate model that improve on the shared responsibility model? Select two answers.

- **The CSP provides more security resources to cloud users.**
  - In shared fate, the cloud service provider invests more time to develop resources to help the customer design, deploy, and operate their cloud environment. As a result, there is a stronger partnership between the users and the cloud service provider.
- Customers are entirely responsible for their data’s security.
- **The CSP and its customers have a stronger relationship.**
  - In shared fate, the cloud service provider invests more time to develop resources to help the customer design, deploy, and operate their cloud environment. As a result, there is a stronger partnership between the users and the cloud service provider.
- Customers must deploy their own cloud resources.
- Customers must configure their own cloud environments.

1.  Question 1
    An organization moves its network to the cloud. Their cloud service provider uses load balancing, which results in faster performance and prevents interruptions. Why does load balancing lead to this outcome? Select two answers.

- It allows applications to communicate with third parties.
- **It ensures high availability of resources.**
  - Load balancing distributes user traffic across several cloud servers, preventing one server from becoming overwhelmed with traffic and ensuring high availability for cloud resources. This leads to faster performance and prevents interruptions.
- It incorporates network monitoring to detect threats.
- It implements hardware routers and switches using software.
- **It prevents servers from being overwhelmed with traffic.**
  - Load balancing distributes user traffic across several cloud servers, preventing one server from becoming overwhelmed with traffic and ensuring high availability for cloud resources. This leads to faster performance and prevents interruptions

2. Question 2
   What can cloud customers use to configure software-defined networking (SDN)?

- Application or network load balancers
- Their CSP’s network load balancing strategy
- Network monitoring or device maintenance
- **Their cloud provider’s console or an application programming interface**
  - Users configure SDN through either their cloud provider’s console, or by using an application programming interface, or API. SDN virtualizes these network devices. As a result, the networking components are abstracted from the physical devices powering the network

3. Question 3
   What is the purpose of a virtual private cloud (VPC)?

- **It enables organizations to use the public cloud’s resources while being completely isolated from other cloud users.**
  - A virtual private cloud, or VPC, is a private cloud hosted within a public cloud, enabling organizations to use the public cloud’s resources while being completely isolated from other cloud users. A VPC allows users to take advantage of public cloud resources while having their own private section.
- It facilitates encrypted connectivity between networks.
- It prevents network segmentation.
- It makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data.

4. Question 4
   What are two benefits of network segmentation? Select two answers.

- **Reduces the network’s attack surface**
  - Segmentation of cloud resources that should not communicate with each other into different subnets reduces the attack surface. Segmentation also allows administrators to pinpoint and isolate issues when they arise. VPCs facilitate segmentation, making them more secure.
- Allows employees to connect from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud
- Determines who can access specific subnets based on IP addresses
- Allows organizations to use a private section of a public cloud
- **Allows issues to be handled more efficiently**
  - Segmentation of cloud resources that should not communicate with each other into different subnets reduces the attack surface. Segmentation also allows administrators to pinpoint and isolate issues when they arise.

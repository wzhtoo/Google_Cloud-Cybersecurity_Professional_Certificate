- Lucidchart
- VirusTotal
- Wireshark

2. Question 2
   A cloud security analyst is training a colleague to use Cloud Shell. Which two tasks might the analyst teach their colleague to do with this tool? Select two answers.

- **Create virtual private clouds (VPCs).**
  - Cloud Shell can be used for a variety of tasks, including creating storage buckets and virtual private clouds. It can also execute Terraform infrastructure as code scripts to build a test, QA, or production environment.
- **Create storage buckets.**

3. Question 3
   A cloud security analyst has been assigned to create virtual machines in Google Cloud. What cloud shell command group can the analyst use?

- Virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Gcloud
- **Compute**
  - The Cloud Shell command group compute can be used to initiate the creation or manipulation of Google Cloud Compute Engine resources, like virtual machines. Different gcloud command groups represent different Google products.
- Linux

4. Question 4
   A cloud security analyst types the following code into the command line interface:

gcloud compute networks create labnet --subnet-mode=custom

What is the function of the word “labnet?”

- **It is the name of the network.**
  - In the input, “labnet” is the name of the network. The other commands in the input create a network using the compute command group.
- It scans the network for spam.
- It lists the networks in the cloud environment.
- It invokes the command line tool.

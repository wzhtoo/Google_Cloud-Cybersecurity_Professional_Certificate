1.  Question 1
    A cloud security analyst is monitoring cloud assets for security and compliance with best practices, regulations, and organization policy. What is this practice called?

- **Cloud security posture management**
  - Cloud security posture management involves monitoring and configuring cloud assets for security and compliance with best practices, regulations, and organization policy. Analysts use cloud security posture management tools, like Google Cloud Security Command Center, as centralized places to find and analyze information about what’s going on in the cloud environment.
- Threat intelligence
- Information risk management
- Security budgeting

2. Question 2
   What is the purpose of cloud security posture management tools?

- **To serve as centralized places to find and analyze information about what’s going on in the cloud environment**
  - Analysts use cloud security posture management tools, like Google Cloud Security Command Center, as centralized places to find and analyze information about what’s going on in the cloud environment.
- To provide insight into methods others have used to respond to and recover from threats
- To communicate technical concepts about the cloud environment to non-technical audiences
- To output strategies to protect cloud assets and automatically eliminate threats

3. Question 3
   What is threat intelligence used for? Select two answers.

- **Stay ahead of potential attackers.**
  - Cloud security analysts use threat intelligence to stay ahead of potential attackers and respond to security incidents. Threat intelligence provides information about prior attacks and how others have responded to them.
- Understand what an organization’s environment includes.
- Educate non-technical workers about security best practices.
- Gain unauthorized access to data.
- **Respond to security incidents.**

4. Question 4
   An organization is developing a security budget. Which process can it use to assess and minimize potential threats to its computing assets?

- **Information risk management**
  - Information risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and minimizing potential threats to information assets. An organization can use this process to prioritize which tools to include in its budget and which assets it should protect. The more money an asset represents for a company, the more they should invest to protect it.
- Cloud security posture management
- Incident response
- Monitoring and configuring

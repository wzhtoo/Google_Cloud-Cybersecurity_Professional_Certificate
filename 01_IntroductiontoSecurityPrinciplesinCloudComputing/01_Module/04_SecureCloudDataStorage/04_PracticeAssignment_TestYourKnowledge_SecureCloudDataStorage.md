1.  Question 1
    A small independent book publisher considers moving its data storage to the cloud. What are two potential benefits of this change? Select two answers.

- The publisher will be able to pre-buy data in case it needs more than expected.
- The publisher’s data will only be stored in one location.
- **The publisher will be able to store more data.**
  - When an organization needs to store more data, they can adjust their use of the cloud accordingly without the need to buy, install, organize, and manage new physical devices. Cloud data storage allows small organizations to store amounts of data they would not have the resources to store on their own. This will help them save money.
- **The publisher will maintain the infrastructure needed to host the data.**
  - When an organization needs to store more data, they can adjust their use of the cloud accordingly without the need to buy, install, organize, and manage new physical devices. This allows them to store more data and also save money. Cloud service providers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure needed to store their customers’ data.
- The publisher will save money.

2. Question 2
   What data type includes names, addresses, credit card numbers, and dates?

- **Structured data**
  - Structured data is organized in a certain format, like rows and columns, and stored in a structured database. Examples of structured data include names, addresses, credit card numbers, and dates. Because it is stored in a structured format, structured data is easy to query and search for.
- Repositories
- Unstructured data
- Redundancy

3. Question 3
   A music recording studio wants to store and organize a large amount of unstructured data in the form of audio files. Which type of cloud storage should they choose?

- **Buckets**
  - A bucket is a virtual container that holds objects and can be used to store and organize large amounts of unstructured data, such as audio files. File storage uses a hierarchy of files in folders; it is ideal for smaller volumes of data that a few people might need access to, like files on a family computer.
- Uptime
- File storage
- Redundancy

4. Question 4
   A team of developers is using a centralized place to store, download, and share data. What is

- this central location called?
- Block storage
- Failure domain
- A structured database
- **A repository**
  - Developers rely on repositories as a centralized place to store, download, and share data. Data repositories commonly use file storage.

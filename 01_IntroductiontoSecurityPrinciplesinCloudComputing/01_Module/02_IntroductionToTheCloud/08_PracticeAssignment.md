1.  Question 1
    All of XYZ Software Company’s infrastructure is physically located in their office. XYZ employees manage all of the servers, networks, and storage. What type of infrastructure does XYZ use?

- Hybrid cloud
- Public cloud
- **On-premises**
  - Since XYZ Software Company’s infrastructure is located entirely in their office, they use an on-premises infrastructure. Cloud infrastructure is hosted in data centers by cloud service providers, also known as CSPs.
- Multicloud

1. Question 2
   What is the term for a resource that can fail without impacting the availability of data?

- Data centers
- **Failure domain**
  - A failure domain is a resource that can fail without impacting the availability of data. In Google Cloud, groupings of zones and regions are called failure domains.
- Zone
- Region

1. Question 3
   Which term describes the time it takes for data to travel from one location to another?

- **Latency**
  - The time it takes for data to travel from one location to another is called latency. This can include data traveling from a user’s device to a cloud server, or between cloud servers.
- Data center
- Digital transformation
- Redundancy

1. Question 4
   What are two advantages of cloud-based infrastructure? Select two answers.

- Reliance on a stable internet connection
- **Cost savings**
  - Reduced data loss and cost savings are two advantages of cloud-based infrastructure. Cloud users only pay for the resources they need, while the CSP is responsible for all up-front costs of physical equipment and spaces, like servers, networking devices, and data centers.
- **Reduced data loss**
  - Reduced data loss and cost savings are two advantages of cloud-based infrastructure. Using the cloud helps avoid damage to business resources and information, and prevents data loss, because redundancy practices ensure information is replicated across failure domains.
- Minimal replication of information
- Direct connection to physical servers

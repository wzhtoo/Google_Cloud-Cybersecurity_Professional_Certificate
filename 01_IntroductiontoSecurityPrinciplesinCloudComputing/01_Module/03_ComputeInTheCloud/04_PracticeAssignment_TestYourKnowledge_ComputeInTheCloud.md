1.  Question 1
    In the cloud, what is the term for computation performed by a physical computer in a remote environment?

- An instance
- **Compute**
  - Computation performed by a physical computer in a remote environment is called compute. For example, memory, CPU, and storage are all compute components.
- Networks
- Data storage

2. Question 2
   What is virtualization?

- Technology that enables organizations to store digital data off-site
- Technology that works as an abstraction layer between the physical computer and the virtual machine
- Technology that ensures that information in one virtual machine is not visible to others
- **Technology that creates a virtual version of physical infrastructure**
  - Virtualization technology creates a virtual version of physical infrastructure, like servers, storage, and networks. The hypervisor is the abstraction layer that sits between the physical computer and the virtual machine.

3. Question 3
   What are two advantages of packaging software in containers? Select two answers.

- **Containers use less memory and fewer resources.**
  - **Feedback :** Packaging software in a container uses less memory and fewer resources, because the operating system itself is not included in the container. This also allows for portability, meaning it enables users to quickly run software applications from one computing environment to another.
- Containers are easy to modify during their lifetimes.
- Containers combine developers and operations teamsâ€™ responsibilities.
- Containers include software and operating systems.
- **Containers enable users to run software quickly from one computing environment to another.**
  - **Feedback :** Packaging software in containers allows for portability, meaning it enables users to quickly run software applications from one computing environment to another. This also uses less memory and fewer resources, because the operating system itself is not included in the container.

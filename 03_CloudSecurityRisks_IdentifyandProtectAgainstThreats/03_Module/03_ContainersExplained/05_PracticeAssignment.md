1.  Question 1
    What is a hypervisor?

- Hardware layer of a virtual machine
- A component of a container runtime
- A tool for managing container images
- **Software used to create and operate virtual machines**
  - A hypervisor is software used to create and operate virtual machines. It allows a host computer to share its memory, processing, and other resources with virtual machines.

2. Question 2
   Anik is a security analyst working on a task that involves executing a single function. Anik can use either containers or virtual machines for this task. Why might Anik use a container rather than a virtual machine?

- **Containers are more lightweight and efficient than virtual machines.**
  - Containers are more lightweight and efficient than virtual machines which makes them suitable for running single functions. Containers are lightweight and efficient because they only include the necessary components needed to run an application, such as the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
- Containers have their own operating system and hardware.
- Virtual machines require more processing power and memory than containers.
- Virtual machines cannot run single functions.

3. Question 3
   What are the roles of a kernel in an operating system? Select two answers.

- A kernel acts as the bridge for data transfer across networks.
- **A kernel manages processes within the operating system.**
  - The roles of a kernel in an operating system include managing processes within the operating system and handling memory allocation and management.
- **A kernel handles memory allocation and management.**
  - The roles of a kernel in an operating system include managing processes within the operating system and handling memory allocation and management.
- A kernel is responsible for the security encryption algorithms.
- A kernel coordinates communication between software applications.

1. Question 4
   An engineer is working on a file system with a new colleague. They begin by explaining the structure of a layered file system in a container. Which of the following is an important characteristic of the layered system?

- **The construction of each layer of a container on top of another layer.**
  - An important characteristic of the layered file system is that each layer of a container is built on top of another layer to form an image.
- The role of the layered system as the primary defense against attacks and vulnerabilities.
- The rule is that only one layer in the image can receive write commands.
- The identical nature of each layer in the system to every other layer.

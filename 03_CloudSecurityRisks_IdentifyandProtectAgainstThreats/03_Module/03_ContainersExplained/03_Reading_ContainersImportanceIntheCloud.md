# Key takeaways

Containers are used for many tasks in the cloud, and have become a major factor of cloud
computing. Containers have several benefits for cloud computing. These benefits include:
isolation, mobility, small size, consistency, quick introduction of new features, easy rollbacks,
and a minimal number of libraries or dependencies. But, containers also have their
disadvantages. Overall, containers can be utilized in a variety of ways, and familiarizing

# Key takeaway

Remember, itâ€™s important to consider what your infrastructureâ€™s security needs are before
deploying infrastructure using Terraform. If you decide Terraform is the best option, itâ€™s
beneficial to implement any changes to the environment in scope through Terraform. This will
help you avoid inadvertent roll-backs of manually applied changes when the scripts run the
next time. Understanding Terraform, how it works, and when it applies will increase your
organizational efficiency, and bolster your security posture.

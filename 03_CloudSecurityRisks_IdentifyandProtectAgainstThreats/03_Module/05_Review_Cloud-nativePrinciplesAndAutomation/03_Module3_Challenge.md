1.  Question 1
    A company heavily relies on containerization for their applications. Why should the company keep the host kernel up-to-date when using containers?

- To enhance the overall system performance
- To limit potential misuse of overly-privileged container configurations
- **To safeguard against potential exploits targeting the shared kernel**
- To prevent interference with executed containerized legacy systems

2. Question 2
   When setting up infrastructure with Terraform, at which point does an IT specialist implement the Sentinel step?

- After they code the infrastructure.
- After they finalize the configuration.
- **Between the planning and applying steps.**
- While they plan the configuration.

3. Question 3
   In the context of DIE, what does it mean if system resources are distributed?

- **They are not reliant on a single area or zone.**
- They are divided equally amongst users.
- They are removed once used.
- They remain unchanged.

4. Question 4
   Bruce owns a start-up company and recently shifted to using cloud services. Who is typically in charge of maintaining the servers and hardware in the cloud?

- The IT department
- The business partners
- **The cloud service provider**
- The users of the service

5. Question 5
   What does the term "container drift" refer to in the context of container technology?

- The movement of a container from one application to another within a network
- **The change in a container from its original image due to alterations in its writable area**
- The drift in version updates of a container's underlying software overtime
- The shift in the spatial arrangement of containers in a data center

6. Question 6
   Johan, a cloud engineer, is considering Kubernetes to handle his company's container deployment needs. What can Kubernetes offer Johan and his company? Select two answers.

- An automated reporting platform to keep track of all company activities
- **A platform that can be largely beneficial in deploying containers**
- **A platform that provides automation for the deployment of resources**
- A software tool for scanning and identifying vulnerabilities within his company's digital infrastructure
- A software solution for the manual manipulation and allocation of containers

7. Question 7
   A start-up company is dealing with a surge in data consumption. To manage their resources more effectively, they decide to use an ephemeral approach. What does this mean for their system resources?

- The startup can duplicate system resources as needed.
- **The startup can dispose of temporary resources when not in use.**
- The startup can distribute resources evenly across all tasks.
- The startup can modify their resources as needed.

8. Question 8
   What does Terraform do with a container?

- It patches the container software.
- **It builds the container.**
- It deploys the container on a physical storage device.
- It turns the container into a standalone database.

9. Question 9
   Zahra is a tech lead at a software development startup. She applies drift prevention to the container images her team is working on. What will be the impact of Zahra's action on those containers?

- The containers will now accommodate additional executables.
- **The containers will become immutable.**
- The containers will gain the ability to execute any files.
- The containers will now have a flexible number of layers.

10. Question 10
    A DevOps Engineer is implementing a strategy known as drift prevention for container security in their projects. What is the main purpose of drift prevention in this context?

- To keep the containers regularly updated
- **To prevent the execution of files not part of the original image**
- To ensure that all container images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- To allow the addition of new executables into the containers

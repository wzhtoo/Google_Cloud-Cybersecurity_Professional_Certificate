# Key takeaways

As a cloud security professional, there are best practices to follow when you need to patch or
rehydrate your infrastructure. You can use patch management to identify, prioritize, acquire,
install, and verify the installation of upgrades, patches, and updates. You can use the
cloud-native approach of rehydration to focus on continual replacement with up-to-date
instances. In the cloud, rehydration is the more common approach in the context of immutable
infrastructure. Youâ€™ll likely be using both patching and rehydration, but rehydration can help
you save time and avoid glitches from failing patches.

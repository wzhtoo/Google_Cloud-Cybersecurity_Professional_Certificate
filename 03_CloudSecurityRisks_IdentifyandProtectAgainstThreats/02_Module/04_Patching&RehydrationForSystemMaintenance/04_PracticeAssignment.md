1.  Question 1
    Why would a cloud security manager prefer rehydration for large-scale, cloud-native environments?

- **It enables faster rollout and minimizes disruptions to services.**
  - Cloud security managers prefer rehydration for large-scale, cloud-native environments because it enables faster rollout and minimizes disruptions to services.
- It involves decommissioning or destroying old instances.
- It involves regular system downtime for patching.
- It requires extensive resources for data and configuration migration.

2. Question 2
   What are the primary benefits of the patching process? Select two answers.

- **Enhancing the system's performance and stability**
  - Enhancing the system's performance and stability and timely fixing of security vulnerabilities are the primary benefits of the patching process.
- Introducing new software features
- **Timely fixing of security vulnerabilities**
  - Enhancing the system's performance and stability and timely fixing of security vulnerabilities are the primary benefits of the patching process.
- Increasing system downtime during patching
- Reducing the cost of the software

3. Question 3
   A company has discovered a minor security flaw in its legacy customer management system. The company relies on this older system for everyday operations, so any significant downtime could severely disrupt the company's operations. What method should the company's IT team use to fix this situation?

- Rehydration
- Deletion
- **Patching**
  - Patching is the best method for this situation. Patching works well with legacy systems and does not require retiring the entire system, which reduces downtime and potential disruptions to the company's operations.
- Reinstantiation

4. Question 4
   A tech startup has developed a new update for its software, which runs on thousands of interconnected IoT devices in a cloud-native environment. This update involves multiple large-scale changes. What approach should the startup adopt for the smooth implementation of this update?

- Reinstantiation
- Ignore the update
- **Rehydration**
  - Rehydration is the ideal approach for this scenario because it makes large-scale updates easier to perform and manage across numerous devices.
- Manual Update

5. Question 5
   A multinational corporation has to rebuild its services after identifying a significant software malfunction. This malfunction affects services running in containerized applications, and the corporation requires a large-scale update with minimal interruption to its operations. What method should the corporation's IT department apply?

- Ignore the malfunction and carry on
- Rehydration
- **Reinstantiation**
- Patch the legacy systems and wait

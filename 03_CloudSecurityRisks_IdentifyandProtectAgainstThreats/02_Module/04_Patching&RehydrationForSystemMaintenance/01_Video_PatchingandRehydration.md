## Rehydration

A cloud-native process where new servers are created with the latest updates and patches, allowing for the workload to the transferred from old servers, and for the outdated servers to be decommissioned or destroyed

## Mechanics of rehydration

- Inventory all resources
- Identify vulnerabilities
- Run updated and old instances to compare
- Redirect traffic from old to new instances

## Machine Learning (ML)

A subset of AI that uses algorithms to larn from data, allowing computers to make decisions and predictions without explicit programming

## Artificial intelligence (AI)

A broader concept encompassing ML and other technologies that creates systems capable of learning, reasoning, and problem-solving

## Key features of cloud security posture management (CSPM) solution

- Automated assessment
- Compliance monitoring
- Policy enforcement
- Real-time alerting and reporting

## Key features of a cloud attack surface management (CSAM [catsam]) solution

- Asset discovery
- Vulnerability assessment
- Threat intelligence integration
- Risk prioritization

## Trends in cloud security

- Zero trust architecture
- Container security
- Edge computing security
- Security as code
- Automated incident response

## Steps to help slove cloud security challenges

- Assess the effectiveness of different technologies and methods
- Determine the suitablility of solutions for unique cloud environments
- Consider scalability to accommodate growth and changing needs
- Evaluate compatibility with existing systems and processes
- Examine ease of integration to ensure smooth implementation

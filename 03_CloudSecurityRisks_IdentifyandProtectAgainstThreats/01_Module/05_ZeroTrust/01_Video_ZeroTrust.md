# Zero trust

[Zero trust ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-security-risks-identify-and-protect-against-threats/lecture/ZyGHt/zero-trust)

## Core principles of zero turst

- Verify explicitly
- Apply least privilege access
- Assume breach

## Implement zero trust policies

- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Micro-segmentation
- Netwrok access control (NAC)

## Micro-segmentation

A security technique that divides a network into smaller, isolated segments

## Netwrok access control (NAC)

A security solution that enforces policy-based access control to network resources, ensuring that only authorized devices and users can access the network

## Context-aware access controls

Decisions about granting or denying access to resources are based on the user's identity and contextual information

## Cloud-native security solutions to enforce zero trust policies

- Cloud Access Security Broker (CSABs)
- Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)

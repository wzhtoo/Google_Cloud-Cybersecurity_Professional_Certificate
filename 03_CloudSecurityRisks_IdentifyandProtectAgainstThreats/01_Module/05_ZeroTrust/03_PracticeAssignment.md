1.  Question 1
    What is meant by the principle "verify explicitly" in the context of zero trust?

- **Every access request must be authenticated and authorized before access is granted to any resource.**
  - In the context of zero trust, "verify explicitly" means that every access request must be authenticated and authorized before access is granted to any resource
- Trust is implicitly granted to every user and device.
- Organizations should operate under the assumption that a breach has already happened.
- Users, devices, and systems should only be granted the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.

2. Question 2
   What role does micro-segmentation play in a zero trust environment?

- It is a platform that combines network and security functions into a single, cloud-based service.
- It is a mechanism for multi-factor authentication.
- **It divides the network into smaller segments to limit unauthorized access and reduce the potential attack surface.**
  - Micro-segmentation divides the network into smaller segments to limit unauthorized access, and reduce the potential attack surface.
- It acts as an intermediary between cloud service users and cloud service providers.

3. Question 3
   In the context of zero trust, what is the purpose of the Network Access Control (NAC) mechanism? Select two answers.

- It combines network and security functions into a single, cloud-based service.
- **It enforces policy-based access control to network resources.**
  - In the context of zero trust, the purpose of the NAC mechanism is to enforce policy-based access control to network resources, and ensure that only authorized devices and users can access the network.
- It ensures that only authorized devices and users can access the network.
- **It ensures that every access request must be authenticated and authorized.**
  - In the context of zero trust, the purpose of the NAC mechanism is to enforce policy-based access control to network resources, and ensure that only authorized devices and users can access the network.
- It establishes encrypted communication channels for all internal network traffic.

4. Question 4
   In a zero trust environment, John, an employee who typically works from the office network, decides to work from a coffee shop. Because of the principles of a zero trust security model, John's request for access to the company's servers is not automatically granted. What is the role of context-aware access controls in this scenario?

- It verifies every access request by authenticating and authorizing before granting access.
- It enforces policy-based access control to network resources.
- **It makes decisions about granting or denying access to resources based on the user's identity, and contextual information like location, device, and behavior patterns.**
  - Decisions about granting or denying access to resources are made based on the user's identity and contextual information, like location, device, and behavior patterns. In this scenario, John is not automatically granted access to the companyâ€™s servers because of context-aware access controls.
- It divides the network into smaller segments to limit unauthorized access, and reduce the potential attack surface.

### Security Principles

- Credential management
- Secrets management
- Non-interactive access

### Secrets

Sensitive information like Application Programming interface (API) keys, passwords, and certificates that are used to authenticate and authorize access to systems

### Best practices for managing Secrets

- Centralized secret management tool
- Strong encryption methods to protect them
- Regular rotation

### 3 Commonly used protocols

- mTLS
- OAuth
- OpenID

### Mutaual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)

A protocol that provides mutual authentication and encryption between servers

### Open Authorization (OAuth)

A method that allows users to grant applications access to their information on other sites or systems, without the need to share their passwords

### OpenID

A protocol that is used for single sign-on functinality, allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple services

1.  Question 1
    Juan transfers money between two company accounts via an online banking portal. Following the transfer, Juan reviews more detailed account information on the same portal. In this scenario, what state is the data returned to?

- Data at rest
- Data on hold
- Data in transit
- **Data in use**
  - Juan is actively reviewing account details by accessing this data, making it data in use. Data in use represents data that's being accessed or processed by one or more users.

2. Question 2
   What is the state of data that moves between a mobile device and a banking app's host?

- Data on the cloud
- **Data in transit**
  - The data moving between a mobile device and a banking app's host is data in transit. Data in transit refers to data that is being moved or transferred from one location or another.
- Data in use
- Data at rest

3. Question 3
   A cybersecurity analyst decides to use confidential computing to enhance the company's security systems. What does the cybersecurity analyst want to protect by implementing confidential computing?

- Data in transit
- ## **Data in use**
  - The cybersecurity analyst wants to protect data in use by implementing confidential computing. Confidential computing does this using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which provide a secure and isolated environment for encrypting data.
- Data backups
- Data at rest

4. Question 4
   When a chunk of data at rest is updated, what happens to its encryption key?

- It is combined with other keys.
- It is scheduled for re-encryption.
- It remains unchanged.
- **It gets a new encryption key.**
  - When a chunk of data at rest is updated, it gets a new encryption key. The keys are regularly updated, providing a more robust layer of security.

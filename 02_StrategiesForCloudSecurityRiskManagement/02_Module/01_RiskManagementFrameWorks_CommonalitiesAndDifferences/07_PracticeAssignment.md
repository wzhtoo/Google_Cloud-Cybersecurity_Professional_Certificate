1.  Question 1
    What is the goal of risk management frameworks?

- To eliminate all risks in a cloud environment
- To provide customized security advice to organizations
- **To reduce risks to acceptable levels**
  - Frameworks are a tool for risk-management; their goal is to reduce risks to an acceptable level and improve security posture. Frameworks identify common goals around cloud security, and provide the structure and common language needed to maintain these goals.
- To discourage the use of third-party services

2. Question 2
   Which framework is used to build trust and confidence for clients about a third-party service providersâ€™ system?

- **SOC 2**
  - The SOC 2 framework leverages the AICPAâ€™s Trust Services Criteria to build trust and confidence for clients about a third-party service providersâ€™ system. The Trust Services Criteria are used to evaluate controls relevant to security, availability, and processing integrity of the system that a third-party service organization uses to process the clientâ€™s data.
- NIST CSF
- ISO 27001
- Processing integrity framework

3.  Question 3
    An organization uses a third-party system to process its customersâ€™ credit card information. What framework can help the organization assess the third-party systemâ€™s security?

- Industry Standard
- CIA
- Standardization Organization
- **SOC 2**
  - SOC 2 is used to evaluate controls relevant to security, availability, and processing integrity of the system that a third-party service organization uses to process a clientâ€™s data. The SOC 2 framework was developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, and is commonly used in cloud security

4.  Question 4
    An organization is using the NIST CSF to inform its new risk management plan. What two goals can this framework help the organization achieve? Select two answers.

- Identify hiring best practices for cybersecurity staff
- **Understand their cybersecurity risks**
  - The NIST CSF helps organizations to better understand, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risk and decide where to focus their time and money for cybersecurity protection. The CSF is a risk-based approach for governing security, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management.
- Train their employees to create virtual machines
- Eliminate all risks in their system
- **Decide where to focus their time and money for cybersecurity protection**
  - The NIST CSF helps organizations to better understand, manage, and reduce their cybersecurity risk and decide where to focus their time and money for cybersecurity protection. The CSF is a risk-based approach for governing security, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management.

5. Question 5
   What is the main goal of ISO 27001?

- **To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information**
  - ISO 27001â€™s main goal is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.
- To separate the goals of different cloud security fields
- To enable all users to change information
- To ensure information can be accessed by anyone

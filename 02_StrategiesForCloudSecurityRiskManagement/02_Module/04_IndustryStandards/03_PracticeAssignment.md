1.  Question 1
    Who is responsible for enforcing Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance?

- ISO
- **Payment card brands**
  - Payment card brands may require merchants to follow PCI-DSS to maintain compliance. The PCI DSS applies to any organization that accepts, transmits, or stores any cardholder data, regardless of the size of the organization, or the number of transactions.
- The PCI council
- Merchants

2.  Question 2
    An employee of a healthcare organization accidentally modifies some user data in a cloud database. The employee is authorized to access the data, but not to change it. Which aspect of information security under ISO 27001 is affected by this event?

- **Integrity**
  - Under ISO 27001, information integrity means that data within an organization is not erased or damaged. Instead, the information should be reliably stored and not changed without authorization. An employee that makes unauthorized changes to data is a risk to the dataâ€™s integrity.
- Currency
- Availability
- Confidentiality

3. Question 3
   A cloud security team is working to adhere to PCI DSS. They have identified all locations of cardholder data, and analyzed processes and IT assets for vulnerabilities that could expose the data. What two steps should they take next? Select two answers.

- Plan to archive all cardholder data indefinitely
- Request assistance enforcing standards from the PCI council
- Discontinue all collection of cardholder data
- **Report the process to the bank and card brands they do business with**
  - To adhere to PCI DSS, cloud security teams should identify vulnerabilities, repair the identified vulnerabilities, and report details of the assessment and remediation process to the bank and card brands they do business with.
- Repair the identified vulnerabilities
  - To adhere to PCI DSS, cloud security teams should identify vulnerabilities, repair the identified vulnerabilities, and report details of the assessment and remediation process to the bank and card brands they do business with. Teams can repair vulnerabilities by securely removing any unnecessary cardholder data and implementing secure business processes.

1.  Question 1
    A cloud security analyst is implementing security controls to reduce risks. What two controls might the analyst be using? Select two answers.

- Secure by design practices
- Data leakage
- **Data encryption**
  - Security controls, such as two-factor authentication and data encryption, reduce the impact or likelihood of threats to reduce risk. If an organization encrypts data, the impact of a potential breach is reduced because the attacker cannot access the data without the key.
- **Two-factor authentication**
  - Security controls, such as two-factor authentication and data encryption, reduce the impact or likelihood of threats to reduce risk. Organizations use two factor authentication in order to reduce the likelihood of a threat actor accessing a network or system if the threat actor steals a password and tries to use it to impersonate a user.
- Risk appetite

2. Question 2
   What is the term for the measure of how much a situation or circumstance affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an asset?

- Impact
- Likelihood
- Vulnerability
- **Risk**

3. Question 3
   A cloud security analyst is working to determine their organizationâ€™s risk appetite for their cloud assets. How can the cloud security analyst achieve this goal?

- Implementing security controls
- Sharing sensitive data with unauthorized users
- **Determining the amount of risk the organization is willing to take on**
  - Risk appetite is the amount of risk an organization is willing to take on and still meet organizational needs. It could also be described as the maximum amount of residual risk an organization will accept after controls and other measures have been put in place.
- Requesting that the CSP provide physical security

4. Question 4
   How are cloud compliance and risk related?

- Compliance certification proves that an organization has eliminated all threats.
- Risk appetite focuses on meeting established industry regulations and standards.
- **Compliance certification proves that an organization is managing risks.**
  - Compliance certification is proof that an organization meets established industry regulations and standards to protect itself from risks. Compliance certifications focus on gathering evidence that security controls are in place at or over a specific time period specified in the audit protocol.
- Risk appetite focuses on gathering evidence that security controls are in place over a specific time period.

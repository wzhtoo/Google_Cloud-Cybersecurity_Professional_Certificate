1.  Question 1
    An organization installs code locks on its office doors. Only authorized employees are given the code. What type of security control are the locks?

- Technical
- Implementation
- **Physical**
  - Physical controls include any concrete means of preventing or detecting unauthorized access to facilities, systems, or assets. Locks are a type of physical control.Security controls reduce the likelihood and impact of harmful attacks.
- Administrative

2. Question 2
   An organization identifies a low-impact, low probability risk with one of its applications. What are two ways the organization can transfer the risk? Select two answers.

- **Buying a cyber insurance policy**
  - An organization can transfer risk by buying a cyber insurance policy that helps cover the risk, or by transferring the risk to the user in the terms of service agreement. Conducting threat modeling can help an organization determine how to best manage risk
- Buying physical controls to protect their virtual machines
- Including multi-factor authentication in the application
- **Including the risk in the applicationâ€™s terms of service**
  - An organization can transfer risk by buying a cyber insurance policy that helps cover the risk, or by transferring the risk to the user in the terms of service agreement. Conducting threat modeling can help an organization determine how to best manage risk.
- Including the risk in their security plan

3. Question 3
   A cloud security team selects and implements a new security control throughout their organization. Where can they communicate how the control relates to their organizationâ€™s risk management goals?

- In the implementation plan
- In the organizationâ€™s security budget
- **In the teamâ€™s security plan document**
  - Cloud security analysts can communicate how controls relate to organizational risk management and compliance goals by recording the security control implementation process in the teamâ€™s security plan.
- In the organizationâ€™s compliance standards

4. Question 4
   A cloud security team has identified a new security control for their organization to use. What step should the team take next?

- **Develop an implementation plan**
- Test and validate the security control
- Record the process in their teamâ€™s security document
- Monitor the security control for effectiveness

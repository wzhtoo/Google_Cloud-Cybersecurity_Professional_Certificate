1.  Question 1
    What is the term for a security control supplied by a cloud service provider?

- **An inherited control**
  - An inherited control is one already provided by a cloud service provider. An organization can use inherited controls to meet their control requirements when using a cloud environment.
- A framework control
- An internal control
- An external control

2. Question 2
   Which two external entities may require an organizationâ€™s cloud environment to adhere to certain standards? Select two answers.

- The organizationâ€™s compliance department
- **One of the organizationâ€™s customers**
  - Examples of external entities include regulators and customers that require compliance. Lack of external compliance may result in a companyâ€™s failure to secure or retain a commercial relationship with a business, or lead to fines and penalties by a regulatory body
- **A regulator in the organizationâ€™s state**
  - Examples of external entities include regulators and customers that require compliance. Lack of external compliance may result in a companyâ€™s failure to secure or retain a commercial relationship with a business, or lead to fines and penalties by a regulatory body.
- One of the organizationâ€™s company policies
- The organizationâ€™s cloud security department

3.  Question 3
    How can an organization maximize the benefit of cloud vendor inherited controls?

- **Adapt the controls to fit business needs**
  - Adapting inherited controls to business requirements can help an organization get the most benefit from its cloud vendor inherited controls. By identifying the inherited controls that align with their chosen framework, a cloud security team can determine how they will build or configure tools and services to meet business objectives.
- Minimize overlap between inherited controls and business requirements
- Audit the cloud service provider for compliance
- Delete the controls and hire a third party to add new ones

4. Question 4
   How do cloud hierarchies help security teams put controls in place efficiently?

- **Controls set at a higher level cascade down to lower levels.**
  - Cloud hierarchies help security teams put controls in place efficiently because policies and controls set at higher levels cascade down to lower levels. Policies and controls can also be set at Folder level and apply to everything inside the Folder.
- Cloud projects created within a hierarchy must have the same rules and controls.
- Controls set at lower levels of a hierarchy apply to all levels above them.
- Cloud hierarchies automatically align with security frameworks.

5. Question 5
   A cloud security team is setting policies in its Google Cloud environment. At which hierarchy level should the team set company-wide controls?

- Folder
- Project
- Policy
- **Organization**
  - Company-wide controls can be set at the Organization level. These policies will then cascade down to lower levels of the hierarchy.

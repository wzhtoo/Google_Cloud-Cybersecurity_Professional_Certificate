1.  Question 1
    An organization is applying security controls to a customer-facing application. What level are these security controls considered to be?

- Service level
- **Workload level**
  - Security controls used at the workload level are applied to a collection of resources or code that delivers business value, like a customer-facing application.
- Detective level
- Platform level

2. Question 2
   The developer of a user-facing app includes a piece of code that repairs damage after unauthorized activity and then notifies administrators of this action. What type of control is this an example of?

- Deterrent controls
- **Corrective controls**
  - Corrective controls are put in place to correct a change from the desired security posture. Corrective controls are designed to reduce the after-effects of an attack.
- Preventative controls
- Compensating controls

3.  Question 3
    A software company is implementing deterrent security controls. What two controls might the company be using? Select two answers.

- **A company-wide policy stating consequences for misusing assets**
  - A deterrent control makes the effort of an attack greater than the reward. For example, a passphrase is more difficult to crack than a traditional password, and a company-wide policy stating the appropriate use of company assets and consequences for misusing them can help to deter insider attacks. Deterrent controls serve as barriers to potential attackers.
- A network monitoring tool
- Antivirus software
- Code that automatically replaces infected virtual machines
- **Passphrases to access company resources**
  - A deterrent control makes the effort of an attack greater than the reward. For example, a passphrase is more difficult to crack than a traditional password, and a company-wide policy stating the appropriate use of company assets and consequences for misusing them can help to deter insider attacks. Deterrent controls serve as barriers to potential attackers

4.  Question 4
    A cloud security team has been assigned to map security controls in their organizationâ€™s cloud environment. Which step should the team complete first?

- **Identify the controls that already exist in their cloud infrastructure**
  - The first step in control mapping is to identify the controls that already exist in an organization's cloud infrastructure. Then, the cloud security team should map a set of required controls to the current controls in place.
- Identify which controls need to be implemented
- Map a set of controls to the current controls in place
- Identify the controls that are not mapped

5. Question 5
   What is a security guardrail?

- A security framework created by a regulator
- An inventory of assets
- A policy rule
- **A broad rule that prevents an insecure action**
  - Security guardrails are broad rules that prevent an insecure or not-policy-aligned action. For example, developers might be allowed to launch services that cannot be exposed to the public internet.

1.  Question 1
    A cloud security analyst is using a programming language to write automated compliance checks against their organizationâ€™s cloud infrastructure. What is the term for this process?

- **Policy as code (PaC)**
  - Policy as code, or PaC, is the use of code to define, manage, and automate policies, rules, and conditions using a high-level programming language. Using PaC is a straightforward way to automate policies across an organization.
- Non-compliance
- Version control
- Auditing software

2. Question 2
   A healthcare provider operating in the United States fails to comply with HIPAA standards. How might reputational risk affect this healthcare provider?

- The providerâ€™s leadership may be imprisoned.
- **Customers may lose trust in the provider.**
  - The reputational risks of non-compliance include a loss of customersâ€™ trust, which can lead to lost business. Reputational risks also include damage to the brandâ€™s reputation with stakeholders, partners, and the general public.
- The provider may need to temporarily shut down.
- A regulator may fine the provider.

3. Question 3
   A cloud security team begins using a policy as code approach in their organizationâ€™s cloud environment. What two benefits will the company receive from this change? Select two answers.

- Security teams will be able to manually enforce policies.
- All changes made to policies will be permanent.
- **Policies will be enforced more accurately.**
  - PaC is easy for stakeholders to check, making it easier for them to understand what is happening in the system. PaC also improves accuracy because policies are automatically enforced. PaC also makes it easier for a security team to utilize automated auditing software to check that the code is valid and doesnâ€™t have any gaps or errors.
- Different departments will no longer need to collaborate.
- **It will be easier for stakeholders to track policies.**
  - PaC is easy for stakeholders to check, making it easier for them to understand what is happening in the system. PaC also improves accuracy because policies are automatically enforced.

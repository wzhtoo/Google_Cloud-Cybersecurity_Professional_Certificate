1.  Question 1
    What information is assessed in a cloud audit?

- Whether the organizationâ€™s cloud resources are accredited
- **How well the organizationâ€™s security controls meet compliance requirements**
  - In a cloud audit, an organizationâ€™s security controls are assessed against compliance requirements. An audit results in a set of findings that describe how well an organization is meeting compliance requirements, and it provides ideas for improvement.
- How well the organization has developed its audit plan
- Whether the organization is growing at a sufficient rate

2. Question 2
   An organization is planning to undergo a security assessment of its cloud environment. What will this process consist of?

- **An automated scan to ensure that controls are in place as intended**
  - Security assessments usually consist of an automated scan to ensure that controls are in place as intended. Security assessments identify flaws in a companyâ€™s technological systems.
- A comprehensive asset inventory by a third party
- A test audit conducted by an internal department
- A scenario test of an organizationâ€™s incident response process

3. Question 3
   An organization is preparing for its cloud environment to undergo an external audit. What two steps should the organization take as part of this process? Select two answers.

- Confirm that data in transit remains unencrypted
- Verify that access to logs is limited
- Obtain ISO 27001 certification
- **Test run an internal audit**
  - When preparing for an audit, an organization should assess its cloud environment and test run its own internal audit. The internal audit should be conducted using the criteria in the audit plan.
- **Assess their cloud environment**
  - When preparing for an audit, an organization should assess its cloud environment and test run its own internal audit. The internal audit should be conducted using the criteria in the audit plan.

4. Question 4
   How can an organization demonstrate to auditors that standards have been met?

Allow the auditors to create an incident response plan

Provide open access to logging

Eliminate network segmentation

- **Prepare reports on existing security controls**
  - Auditors can use reports on existing security controls as one way to determine if an organization has met standards. Auditors also verify security controls to ensure they are implemented and working correctly.

5. Question 5
   How can an organization avoid spending too much time preparing for an audit?

- They should discontinue use of third-party risk management processes.
- They should only hire independent auditors without accreditation.
- They should temporarily turn off multi-factor authentication for cloud assets.
- **They should have processes in place that align with audit standards.**
  - Since audit preparation is time consuming, itâ€™s important to have processes in place that overlap with audit standards. Two of the biggest challenges in preparing for an audit are time and resources.

    What is the purpose of security guardrails?

- **To prevent insecure actions**
- To eliminate the need to create custom code
- To replace regulatory and compliance frameworks

2. Question 2

A doctorâ€™s office in the United States handles sensitive health information and processes payment card data. Their cloud service provider is PCI DSS certified, but not certified in a HIPAA compliant framework. How can the organization most effectively meet both HIPAA and PCI DSS compliance obligations?

- **Inherit the HIPAA controls and build on them to comply with PCI DSS.**
- Audit the CSP for compliance with HIPAA.
- Configure the CSPâ€™s controls to turn off cloud logging.

- **Non-compliance**
- Policy as code
- Version control
- Cloud hierarchy

9. Question 9

- **Organization**
- Folder
- Project
- Cascade

10. Question 10

Which factor determines the programming language an organization uses for policy as code (PaC)?

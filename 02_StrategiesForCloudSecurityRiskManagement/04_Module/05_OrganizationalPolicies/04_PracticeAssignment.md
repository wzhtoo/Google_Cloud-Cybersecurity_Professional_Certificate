1.  Question 1

A cloud security professional is setting up organizational policies for different project resources. What do tags help cloud security professionals do when setting up organizational policies? Select two answers.

- Delete groups of resources
- **Define groups of resources**
  - Tags help cloud security professionals define groups of resources and assign constraints to all resources in a group. This allows for better organization and management of resources within the cloud environment.
- Break up groups of resources
- Duplicate security policies for resource groups
- **Assign constraints to all resources in a group**
  - Tags help cloud security professionals define groups of resources. Tags can also be used to assign specific constraints or policies to all resources within a certain group.

2. Question 2
   A cloud security professional creates a default service account. What role includes a large number of permissions and can pose a security risk if an account is compromised?

- Viewer role
- **Editor role**
- Admin role
- User role

3. Question 3
   What purpose does a list constraint serve in the context of data residency requirements?

- It sets a limit for the number of cloud resources that can be created.
- **It specifies a set of locations where cloud resources can be created.**
  - The primary purpose of a list constraint in the context of data residency requirements is to specify a set of locations where cloud resources can be created. Following this constraint, if someone tries to publish a resource in an unspecified location, an error will be displayed, the resource won't be created, and the attempt will be logged.
- It selects the specific employees who can create cloud resources.
- It lists the types of cloud resources an organization can use.

4. Question 4

A cloud security professional wants to implement a domain restricted sharing constraint in the Organization Policy Service. What will this constraint limit in the company's cloud resources?

- The storage capacity for data

- The locations where resources can be created

- The overall number of features available in the cloud service

- **The identities for use in Identity and Access Management policies**
  - The domain restricted sharing constraint limits the set of identities that are allowed in Identity and Access Management policies. This control mechanism helps organizations restrict sharing and enhances the security of cloud resources by ensuring only authorized identities have access.

1.  Question 1
    A cybersecurity analyst frequently uses a Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVEÂ®) identifier while discussing software vulnerabilities. What is the primary purpose of using a CVEÂ® identifier?

- To tailor security patches specifically for each identified vulnerability
- To evaluate the structure and roles within the organization
- To monitor the movements and actions of potential cyber criminals
- **To streamline communication and sharing of vulnerability information**
  - The primary purpose of using a CVEÂ® identifier is to streamline communication and sharing of vulnerability information. Giving each vulnerability a unique CVEÂ® identifier makes it easier to discuss specific vulnerabilities.

2. Question 2
   Cybersecurity specialists often refer to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). What is the NVD?

- A user data catalog
- A private registry of vulnerabilities within commercial organizations
- A vendor reporting platform
- **A public repository of system and software vulnerabilities**
  - The NVD is a public repository that provides information on system and software vulnerabilities. It is created and updated by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).

3. Question 3
   Neha is a security engineer. As part of her work, she has to frequently consult the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASPÂ®) Top Ten report. What information does the OWASPÂ® Top Ten report have that Neha needs to refer to?

- A list of the top ten cloud security experts of the year
- The leading ten cybersecurity events of the year
- **A list of crucial security threats for web applications**
  - The OWASPÂ® Top Ten report has a list of critical security threats for web applications. Security professionals such as Neha use this list as a reference guide in their efforts to ensure the safety of web applications.
- The most useful processes for repairing software vulnerabilities

4. Question 4
   What is the purpose of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASPÂ®) Top Ten? Select two answers.

- To collect donations for cybersecurity research
- To advertise web application firewalls
- **To guide security testing efforts**
  - The purposes of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASPÂ®) Top Ten are to guide security testing efforts and minimize vulnerabilities in cloud environments. One of the purposes of the OWASPÂ® Top Ten is to guide security testing efforts by helping security professionals identify and address the most crucial security threats that impact web applications.
- To highlight high-profile security breaches
- **To minimize vulnerabilities in cloud environments**
  - The purposes of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASPÂ®) Top Ten are to guide security testing efforts and minimize vulnerabilities in cloud environments. Mitigating security risks in web applications can help ensure that cloud environments are more secure by minimizing vulnerabilities that could lead to breaches.
